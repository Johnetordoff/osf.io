    QuickFolder's a are specialized OsfStorageFolder models that are attached to the user instead of a
    project, preprint, registration etc. QuickFolders have a few special restrictions normal Folder models don't have.

    1. They must have a flat file structure. Quickfolders can have no parents nor can it's children be folders.
    2. They must be attached to a user on creation, meaning the their target must always be a OSFUser instance.
    3. If a user is deleted, disabled or marked as spam that user's quickfiles must become inaccessible.
    4. Quickfiles must appear in ES results unless the user is deleted, disabled or marked as spam.
    5. When loggable events (file uploads, renames .etc) happen to Quickfiles they are logged with that user's info,
    though currently user logs aren't displayed.
    6. A Quickfolder's title must reflect user's name in a grammatically correct way.
    7. When a Quickfile is viewed/downloaded it only counts toward the metrics if the view/download is done by a user
    who doesn't own the Quickfolder that file was in.
