The second hypothesis is that providers will be more likely to comply when they are informed that international standards are enforced by domestic agencies, which can\napply meaningful penalties (H2), than when they are only prompted about international standards. This is broadly consistent with a realist view that compliance with international standards will only\noccur when backed up with state power. The third expectation is that service providers will be more likely to allow anonymous incorporation to a client from an explicitly non-corrupt country as opposed\nto a potential client from a clearly corrupt nation (H3). Finally, our fourth expectation is that providers in the United States will be far less likely to allow any client associated with global terror to\nincorporate without disclosing identification (H4). We expect the most significant treatment effects from H4, and suspect that the previous three treatments will garner much less substantial or statistically\ninsignificant effects. In the international sample, the alias consultant makes an inquiry that is identical to the one in\nthe U.S. control condition. In this case, however, the researcher purports to be from one of the basket\nof low-corruption countries discussed in treatment three above (Denmark, New Zealand, Finland,\nSweden, Netherlands, Australia, Norway, or Austria), instead of from a \u2015Guineastan\u2016 nation.\nPrior evidence suggests that U.S. incorporators are probably inclined to offer anonymous incorporation\nto the bulk of their clients; however, we presume that providers worldwide may exercise more\ndiscretion. So, we posit that sending the control emails from one of the world\u2019s least-corrupt nations\nmay raise fewer \u2015red flags,\u2016 as it were, and increase our likelihood of seeing effects from the various\ntreatments. The first international treatment is nearly identical to the first treatment in the U.S. sample\nand invokes the regulatory power of the FATF. In a similar manner, we hypothesize that service\nproviders worldwide should be somewhat more likely to follow international standards when they\nreceive a prompt about the existence of these standards (H5). The second treatment is identical to\nthe control, but it lists the United States as its country of origin instead of the non-corrupt basket of\ncountries. In this case, we are evaluating the difference that a request from the U.S. as the global\nhegemon has on service\u2019s likelihood of allowing anonymous incorporation. We expect that most\nproviders will be less likely to accept anonymous incorporation from hegemon-based clients and\nalso predict that this treatment will garner some of our most significant results (H6).\n23\nThe seventh and eighth treatments similarly reference the FATF, but they also offer rationales\nfor raising the question of international law, mapping to different approaches core to the international\nrelations literature. These treatments probe how incorporation services respond to rationalist\nor normative references to international standards. The treatment and matching hypothesis (H7) is\ndesigned to tap a constructivist logic of appropriateness. According to this view, actors engage in\nethical reasoning to ensure their behavior conforms with generally shared conceptions of appropriate\nconduct. Thus H7 maintains that service providers will be more likely to comply, relative to the\ncontrol condition but not necessarily compared to treatments one and two, if they are provided with\ncues about the appropriate course of action to preserve their self-esteem and reputation for propriety.\n\nThe next treatment substitutes an explicitly rationalist logic of consequences whereby noncompliance\nruns the risk of costly punishment. Hypothesis eight thus explains compliance as a costbenefit\ncalculation by service providers seeking to avoid sanctions (H8), and we expect that compliance\nshould increase relative to the control, but are agnostic about whether compliance should be\nhigher or lower than other conditions.

Raising money from wealthy charitable donors, they provide small-scale loans to the world\u2019s poor to enable microenterprises to lift borrowers out of poverty.  As charitable organizations, the primary goal of MFIs is to relieve poverty, with secondary goals of female empowerment, social capital formation, improved education, and better health, among others.  Microfinance has spread to as many as 300 million borrowers worldwide and garnered the Nobel Peace Prize for the pathbreaking Grameen Bank and its founder, Muhammad Yunus. But recently, among other accustations, a firestorm of criticism has swirled around the movement in the wake of reported suicides in Bangladesh by over-indebted Grameen borrowers. A fierce debate rages over the effectiveness of microcredit. \n\nDevelopment economists have explored the effects of microcredit with careful scientific studies employing randomized control trials.  Led by Yale\u2019s Dean Karlan and Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo of MIT, the several studies suggest mixed results.  The studies suggest that microcredit is very effective at enabling small-business owners or people inclined toward entrepreneurship to capitalize their businesses and curb frivolous consumption, but it appears to have no general poverty-reducing effects across a population or to promote female empowerment, health, or education.\n\nWhen Banerjee and Duflo, along with co-authors Rachel Glennerster and Cynthia Kinnan, released the results of their extensive 18-month study performed in Hyderabad, India, in 2010, microcredit boosters fought back. Representatives of the six largest MFIs worldwide assumed that all the results would be negative (they were not) and reacted by producing six anecdotes of successful borrowers. Adding to the attack, Brigit Helms, CEO of Unitus, an international MFI, declared in a Seattle Times op-ed, \u201cThese studies are giving the inaccurate impression that increasing access to basic financial services has no real benefit\u201d (Helms 2010). However, the Karlan and Duflo experiments do not report negative findings, they show mixed results and suggest that microcredit can be part of the answer to the problem of global development (Banerjee and Duflo 2011). \n\nThe current study seeks to assess how generalized this negative reaction to scientific findings might be.  We randomly assign short descriptions of and citations to two parallel randomized control trials of microcredit by Karlan and co-author Jonathan Zinman. One study, published in the Review of Financial Studies, found positive effects for microcredit.  The other, published in Science, reported null results.  A control condition presents no additional scientific information.  We follow with a sincere request for MFIs to learn more about a possible partnership in a future randomized evaluation with BYU\u2019s Political Economy and Development Lab.

We compiled a comprehensive list of microfinance organizations with email addresses from Mixmarket.org and the Directory of Development Organizations. Together we found more than 5,800 MFIs: 1,419 from Mixmarket.org and 4,424 from the Directory of Development Organizations.\n\n2. We randomly assign the MFIs into three groups: a positive information treatment, a negative information treatment, and a control. We block randomize based on geographic region (Latin America and the Caribbean, Sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East and North Africa, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, South Asia, and East Asia and the Pacific). We suspect that location may influence how MFIs will respond to the treatment, though we have no prior hypotheses about directions of causality for region.\n\n3.

The positive treatment includes a priming statement, accompanied by a summary and citation to a field experimental study, claiming that academic research suggests that microfinance is effective. The negative treatment is identical to the positive treatment but summarizes and cites an article reporting that microfinance is ineffective. Both treatments cite different articles from the same authors, Karlan and Zinman, who run impact evaluations using a similar research design in two different countries and find opposite results.  The control email leaves out the treatment paragraph entirely. All emails are identical in wording except for the treatment paragraph.  See example below.\n\n4.

The subject line for these emails is \"Potential Partnership.\" The invitation for MFIs to request additional information about a partnership on an impact evaluation is fully sincere: PEDL is actively seeking partnerships with MFIs and other NGOs for future randomized evaluations. The emails make clear that they are not invitations for immediate partnerships, which would require funding and mutual availability, so there is no deception in the communication.  \n\n5.

These findings are interesting, but microfinance institutions vary, so you may want to know your program\u2019s particular results. \n\n\nNEGATIVE TREATMENT\n\nCredible academic research suggests that microfinance may be ineffective.

These findings are interesting, but microfinance institutions vary, so you may want to know your program\u2019s particular results.\n\n\nDATA ANALYSIS PLAN\n\nUpon completion of the field study, data will first be analyzed by performing simple difference-in-means tests between control and treatment conditions and between the treatment conditions.  Sub-group difference-in-means tests will also be performed within the regional blocs. We have attempted to balance the key regional covariates with the block randomization procedure, so the need for regression analysis should be minimal. However, further logit and probit regression analyses, controlling for fixed effects for the regional groups, will be employed to check robustness. Very low response rates may require the employment of rare-events logistic analysis as an additional robustness check.  While there will likely be near-perfect overlap, response rates \u2013 including both negative and positive responses \u2013 will be analyzed separate from positive response rates.", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "timestamp": 41117.3487962963}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "While significant literature on NGO theory and behavior already exists, most of what has been written is anecdotal, produced within the NGO community, and based on small, non-random samples. The current body of research lacks independent and scientific study of NGO behavior Though there are some examples, these outliers are rare and difficult to generalize (see Reinikka and Svensson 2001). As NGOs become more influential in development, a more scientific understanding of their behavior becomes critical (Aldashev and Verdier 2010; Doh and Teegen 2002). In order to increase the body of scientific knowledge concerning NGO behavior, we perform a randomized field experiment designed to measure the extent of NGO opportunism. \n Variation in NGO type and function increases the difficulty of generalizing about NGO behavior (hence the need for a randomized controlled experiment). For some time, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have played an important role in public good provision and development initiatives. Because most NGOs claim non-profit status, political neutrality, liberal ideology, and a normative agenda, NGOs are considered by many to be the ideal mechanism for success in these important assignments. In some cases, NGOs may be the only mechanism. Yet the term \u201cNGO\u201d can apply to wide range of organizations (Spar and Dail 2002). Indeed, the variation can be so great (and multi-dimensional) that two NGOs may have nothing in common besides their non-profit, non-government status. NGOs may be international or community-based, well-funded or non-funded, infrastructure-oriented or advocacy-oriented. In short, it is a mistake to treat NGOs as a black box. \nFurthermore, the nature of typical NGO projects does not lend itself easily to measurement and accountability. Traditional mechanisms of accountability employed in the for-profit sector are ineffective in the NGO-sector. NGOs may not be concerned with increasing revenue or maximizing profits. There are few established professional codes of conduct to compare across organizations. The outcome of NGO projects and initiatives are often non-quantifiable (Fowler 1996). As mentioned, this leads many to speculate about the effects of increased NGO population and competition for funding. Many are hopeful, assuming NGOs will cooperate, coordinate and be unaffected in pursuit of their organizational missions (Matthews 1997; Simmons 1998; Price 1998). Others are less optimistic, claiming that NGOs will behave opportunistically in order to survive in an uncertain environment (Cooley and Ron 2002; Aldashev and Verdier 2010). \nMany point to growing principal-agent problems between donors, NGOs, and constituents (Brown and Moore 2001; Doh and Teegen 2002). It is important to note that none of this necessarily suggests that NGOs are becoming inherently corrupt and dishonest, or that their altruistic missions have changed. It does suggest that as competition for donor funds increases and as NGOs become more populous, NGOs may need to behave selfishly or opportunistically in some domains for their own preservation. At times, self-interested NGO priorities may not agree with those of their donors or their constituents (Cooley and Ron 2002). \nThe current study seeks to assess whether NGOs behave opportunistically in the context of establishing a partnership with a research institution for future projects and funding. We randomly assign five conditions across a large sample of NGOs (n > 10,000). In each condition, NGOs are informed (via email) about the possibility of a future partnership with the Political Economy and Development Lab (PEDL). At the end of the email, each NGO is asked to reply with the estimated reimbursement cost for the use of their staff members in the future partnership. Each treatment condition receives a different level of additional information about PEDL in the text of the email. We analyze the effect of this additional information on the estimated reimbursement cost. The extent to which the estimated reimbursement cost varies relative to the control condition is our measure of opportunistic behavior.

(I) When an audit is promised to evaluate an eventual partnership between PEDL and an NGO, estimated reimbursement costs will increase as NGOs are more careful to account for even minor expenses related to the project. (II) Implied project competition will increase reimbursement cost as NGOs may not respond to market competition incentives, but instead may be motivated to signal credibility through higher costs. (III) Information revealing PEDL\u2019s familiarity with NGO partnerships\u2014suggesting minimal information asymmetry\u2014should decrease estimated reimbursement cost. (IV) NGOs\u2019 estimated reimbursement costs will increase when given information suggesting wealthy donors and abundant resources.\n\nTreatment 1, the Audit Condition, receives the following additional language:\n\n\u201cBut please be aware that all PEDL projects are subject to thorough audits, so any expenses in future partnerships will be carefully scrutinized.\u201d\n\nThis additional information should prompt NGOs to be more careful when they respond with their reimbursement cost per staff member per day. A prima facie expectation might be that NGOs will lower their estimates in wariness of being revealed to have submitted inflated bids.  Alternatively, as NGOs are more careful in the calculation of their reimbursement cost, we might also expect that they will factor more expenses into their estimates. Thus, despite the logic behind the avoidance of being caught inflating bids, we expect estimates to increase in response to the Audit Condition. Additionally, because of the added accountability, we expect this treatment will also decrease response rates. Some NGOs may be discouraged from responding because they are unaccustomed to rigorous audits or lack the organization to handle them. \n\nTreatment 2, the Competition Condition, is designed to signal to the recipient NGOs that PEDL is considering the reimbursement cost estimates of multiple NGOs. The treatment implies that PEDL is most likely to partner with the NGO that provides the most competitive estimate. The additional language added to this e-mail is found here: \n\n\u201cAlso, please be aware that we are sending a similar email to many NGOs, so there may be competition for future partnerships.\u201d\n \nMicroeconomic theory suggests that competition should induce lower prices.  Therefore, NGOs should submit lower bids in this condition.  However, while NGOs have strong incentives to contract with PEDL for future partnerships, we suspect that NGOs operate with the understanding that credibility may be more important than cost in the non-profit sector. Furthermore, NGOs may operate with the understanding that higher reimbursement cost is a signal of credibility and competence. Based on these assumptions and against microeconomic expectations, we expect that NGOs will increase their reimbursement estimates in response to the Competition Condition. \n\nTreatment 3, the Prior Knowledge Condition, is designed to suggest minimal information asymmetry between the donor/partner and the local NGO. Often miscommunication and confusion results from information asymmetry, which leads to increased financial cost and inefficiency in development work. Implying that PEDL has partnered with NGOs before and is familiar with typical reimbursement costs should reduce confusion and push NGOs to be more careful calculating their estimates. The additional language for this treatment is as follows: \n\n\u201cAlso, please be aware that we have worked with NGOs in multiple countries, so we have become familiar with average personnel costs.\u201c\n\nWe expect this additional information will prompt NGOs to lower their reimbursement estimates compared to the control group. \n\nLastly, Treatment 4, the Big Money Condition, contains the following additional language: \n\n\u201cAlso, please be aware that past projects have been supported by more than $3 million in grants and contracts from donors including the Gates Foundation, the Hewlett Foundation, the World Bank, and the African Development Bank, so PEDL typically brings significant resources to partnerships.\u201d\n\nThis treatment suggests that PEDL is well funded and endowed with abundant resources. This provides an incentive for NGOs to inflate their reimbursement estimates because there are no institutional constraints or traditional ranges for reimbursement costs in development work.  We expect that NGOs will behave opportunistically by increasing their reimbursement estimates in response to this treatment. We also suspect that response rates will increase due to this treatment. Because the information suggests there is significant money and resources available, we expect NGOs will be more confident in their chances of establishing a partnership.

Within each area are either three or four locations where the confederate and the recorder are positioned to approach subjects, according to the protocol detailed below. On a particular day, the area of research is chosen based on convenience; however, treatments are assigned to specific locations randomly. On each day of research at midday, researchers rotate locations based on the randomization scheme.\n\nTreatments \nIn this study, there are three treatments and two main subcategories across all of the treatments. The treatments are businessperson, aid worker, and student signaling different levels of socio-economic status. These treatments are signaled to subjects verbally and through appearance. For each of the treatments there is a corresponding line in the script used to signal that the confederate represents one of the treatment conditions (see script below). Confederates are also dressed in the clothes that are commonly associated with each of the treatments: dress clothes (i.e. suits) for the businessperson treatment, business casual for the aid worker treatment, and casual clothes for the student treatment. \n\nEach treatment is also divided into subcategories that are shared across the treatments. The subcategories are female and male, and local and foreigner. Local Ugandan citizens of both genders are hired to be confederates and recorders along with American researchers of both genders. Treatment subcategories are designated on a particular day by convenience but assigned randomly to given locations. \n\nWe will gather data for each combination of treatment and subcategory so we will be able to employ a full factorial design. This will allow us to compare each treatment and subcategory combination to all of the other treatment and subcategory combinations in our analysis.\n\nRandomization Scheme\nIn areas throughout downtown Kampala, locations are determined and numbered in advance. During the location scouting, locations are numbered based on the order in which they were found. The three treatments then are randomly assigned to the predetermined locations (i.e. the businessperson treatment is randomly assigned to location 2 of a particular area on a particular day). Thus, while the area of work is determined by convenience on a particular day, the treatments are randomly assigned to the research locations within an area. We maintain that this process of approaching people on the street at various locations within various areas at time intervals determined in the protocol is a particularly random method of sampling. This, coupled with the random assignment of treatment type to the research location, allows each subject to have an equal chance of being assigned any of the experimental conditions. \n\nProtocol\n1. Researcher stands in location and the recorder takes his/her position.\n\n2. Recorder measures 2 minutes and at the end of that period the researcher contacts the closest person (to the researcher\u2019s right, if there is more than one person).\n\t\na. The researcher approaches a subject:\ni. recorder begins timing the encounter,\nii. the subject asks a question or objects (ex. \u201cNo, I cannot, please\u201d or \u201cNo, I do not want to, please\u201d),\n1. see response scenarios below;\n\nb.

The subject refuses to buy airtime:\ni. the response is coded appropriately,\nii. the recorder begins the stopwatch and the researcher initiates another encounter after 2 minutes has passed. \n\nIf the interaction with the subject deviates substantially from the above situations, i.e. the subject persists in asking questions which researchers cannot answer without violating the protocol, i.e., he or she offers to give researcher a ride, acts erratically, etc., the researchers tells the subject \u201cnever mind,\u201d ends the interaction, and the observation is coded as a \u201cdrop.\u201d Drops are later checked to verify that they are randomly distributed and not sensitive to treatments.\n\nAfter the researcher has coded the response, the pair of researchers wait 2 minutes before selecting the next subject, repeating step 2.\n\nScript\nInitial Contact\n\u201cSebo/Nyabo:\n[I need to get to a meeting with some fellow students/ I need to get to a meeting with some other NGO workers/ I need to get to a business meeting] and my driver was supposed to come here and pick me up.

Because we employ a full factorial design, we are able to compare a single treatment and subcategory combination (Aid Worker, Female, Ugandan) or a single treatment (Businessperson or not) to all of the other treatment and subcategory combinations pooled; this makes the difference-of-means test especially useful. In addition to this testing, we will also check for heterogeneous treatment effects in the areas listed in the fourth hypothesis.

Theories of ethnic identity formation have largely converged in recent years: most work now occurs within a constructivist paradigm. And scholars have begun turning their attention to understanding specific constructivist mechanisms. In this project we propose examining the activation of different aspects of a person\u2019s ethnic identity to understand the extent to which individuals shift how they identify themselves.\n\nWe use a lab-in-field experiment in Uganda to systematically induce attention to a new aspect of an individual\u2019s identity and then observe to what extent people shift and identify more with the newly activated identity. Uganda is home to many ethnic groups some of which are more similar than others. All ethnic groups in Uganda fall under three broader language families, Bantu, Nilotic, and Central Sudanic.  Each family comes from a different area with different characteristics.  Though identity in Uganda is primarily based on ethnicity, Ugandans are typically aware of the differences between language families and the common ancestry that ethnicities within each language family share.  \n\nWe examine whether and to what extent individuals shift within ethnicity and language family in their joint interactions. Our specific goal is test whether the introduction of certain institutions (described below) most often introduced by the state increase the likelihood that Ugandans shift their identity from their immediate ethnic group to their broader language family.  \n\nTo be more precise, we establish a context in which we can examine whether subjects will shift emphasis away from co-ethnics within their language family to individuals of a different ethnic group who are still within the same language family. We also consider whether those within the same language family (co-ethnic or not) are preferred to non-co-ethnics who are also not of the same language family. \n\nThe motivation for this approach is rooted in much research, but summarized in Chandra (2012). We hope to learn which institutions are most effective at inducing the activation of a separate aspect of identity relative to not introducing such institutions as well as learning which of the institutional mechanisms is more successful than others. \n\nIn the experiment, we allow the possibility of activation of the language family over ethnicity, but such activation is necessarily a short-term outcome. Although the interventions and effects in the experiment may not be lasting, they inform several different ideas within constructivist approaches as well as the larger literature on identity formation and change.

Accordingly, in our control group we establish a baseline level of favoritism for co-ethnics relative to non-co-ethnics without attempting to induce any shifts. The treatments then introduce various pieces of information through small group dialogue or objective identifying information to understand whether it activates other aspects of a person\u2019s identity and away from one\u2019s own ethnic group to other ethnic groups within one\u2019s language family. We describe the specific protocol in greater detail below, but we test the following hypotheses. \n\nH1:  In the control group, subjects are more likely to show favoritism towards a co-ethnic compared to the two non-co-ethnics (e.g., Muganda should favor Muganda within Bantu family over Munyankole or Acholi). Subjects should not be any more likely to favor either of the non-coethnics in which one is of the same language family and one is not (e.g., Muganda should not favor Munyankole over Acholi even though Munyankole is of the same language family). \n\nH2:  In treatment 1, subjects should favor non co-ethnics of their same language family at least as much as co-ethnics (e.g., Muganda should favor Munyankole at least as much as Muganda, because both are Bantu). Subjects should favor both the co-ethnic and the non-co-ethnic of the same language family over the non-co-ethnic of a different language family (e.g., Muganda should prefer both Muganda and Munyankole over Acholi).  \n\nH3: In treatment 2, subjects should favor non co-ethnics of their same language family at least as much as co-ethnics (e.g., Muganda should favor Munyankole at least as much as Muganda, because both are Bantu). Subjects should favor both the co-ethnic and the non-co-ethnic of the same language family over the non-co-ethnic of a different language family (e.g., Muganda should prefer both Muganda and Munyankole over Acholi).  Treatment 1 should have a stronger effect than treatment 2 given the more pronounced social pressure effect in treatment 1.\n\nH4: In treatment 3, subjects should favor non co-ethnics of their same language family at least as much as co-ethnics (e.g., Muganda should favor Munyankole at least as much as Muganda, because both are Bantu).

One sample will consist of ethnic groups from the Bantu language family. The other sample will consist of ethnic groups from the Nilotic language family.  The Bantu sample will primarily come from Kampala because of its high concentration of Bantu ethnicities, and the Nilotic sample will primarily come from Gulu for the same reason.  Subjects from both samples will be randomly recruited from multi-ethnic neighborhoods within both cities. We have trained local Ugandan recruiters to go door-to-door and follow a protocol to produce a representative, random sample.  \n\nOnce recruited, subjects will come to a lab where they will participate in the experiment.  At the lab, subjects will first fill out a pre-survey where they will provide their demographic information, including ethnicity and, in some conditions, language family.  After filling out the pre-survey, subjects will enter a waiting room where they will then be placed into groups with confederates posing as subjects.  Each group will consist of (1) the subject, (2) a co-ethnic confederate, and (3) two non co-ethnic confederates of which one is of the same language family and one is not.  Confederates will either be of a Bantu or Nilotic ethnic group.  To minimize the risk of group-specific effects, we hired a group of confederates and randomly select which confederates work on which days. Each confederate will participate in two extensive training sessions to ensure quality of group deliberation. After the group is formed, the subject and the confederates will move to the next room where they will wait for five minutes before all playing a form of the dictator game.  During those five minutes, the confederates will initiate conversation and either the control or treatment will be introduced. \n\nIn Habyarimana et al. (2009), they find that when co-ethnics are forced to discriminate in the dictator game (while being observed by their co-ethnics) that they will discriminate in favor of their co-ethnics.  We use this discrimination as our behavioral measure of identity activation.  The goal is to assess whether subjects will not only discriminate in favor of their co-ethnics in the dictator game, but also in favor of their non-co-ethnics that are of the same language family. Put differently, we examine whether individuals will activate a different aspect of their identity under some conditions and allocate money in a dictator game based on the activation of the new identity. Because each round of the dictator game in this experiment consists of four players (subject plus three confederates), each player will be given three bills, two of which will be worth 2,000 UGX and one worth 1,000 UGX.   \n\nThe purpose of the 1,000 UGX bill is to allow disproportionate allocation that could help separate co-ethnics from non-co-ethnics of the same language family by allowing the possibility of observing greater preference for non-co-ethnics of the same language family (or not). Thus, in the treatment groups, the 1,000 UGX bill will allow us to possibly assess whether the co-ethnic or the non-co-ethnic of the same language family receives more money.  \n\nTreatments and Control\n\nControl\nWhile waiting for the five minutes before the dictator game begins, confederates will engage in conversation with the subject in which they will introduce themselves and reveal their ethnic identity.  After identities are revealed, confederates will ensure that any conversation steers away from ethnicity or any other topic that may stir feelings of identity within the subject. Notably, confederates will not introduce any discussion about language family in the control condition.   \n\nTreatment 1\nSubjects in the treatment group will be asked to not only claim their ethnicity but also what language family they and their parents belong to.  These questions on the pre-survey are designed to capture the idea of how claiming an ethnicity or language family on the census can cognitively prime the idea of belonging to certain groups.  Then, in the waiting room confederates will engage in conversation surrounding ethnicity.  The conversation will focus on how the subject\u2019s ethnicity is similar to those of the two confederates of the same language family and different from the third confederate, building the idea that the subject comes from a single Bantu or Nilotic language family.  This conversation imitates the idea that the repertoire of the nominal attributes generated by the census concerning what constitutes an ethnic group could result in the activation of different identities.\n\nTreatment 2\nSubjects and confederates will be given a name badge that states their name and below it their language family. No special conversation will take place as in the control group.  This treatment more strongly tests the effect of institutions by clearly categorizing subjects and confederates into new identities.  It also tests the idea of how the repertoire of the descent-based attributes generated by the census determines it.  By making the subject and confederates\u2019 new identities visible through the use of a name badge, we are testing whether language family can be activated to the point where subjects will give preference based on it. \n\nTreatment 3\nThis last treatment will be a joint intervention of treatments 1 and 2.  \n\nPost Survey\nAfter the dictator game has been played, subjects in all treatment and the control groups will be given a post-survey in which two different scales will be administered to rate how strongly they identify with their ethnicity and language family. These additional questions will be used for additional secondary analyses.\n\nBasic Data Analysis Plan\nData will be analyzed by performing simple difference-in-means tests between control and each treatment condition, and then among pairs of treatment conditions.

The body of studies that have probed the salience of positive income changes, such as interest payments from a savings account, is newer.  Karlan et al (2010) find that reminders can increase savings, and boost salience  of specific expenditures by labeling savings accounts with what the consumers hope to save for (for example, housing or education).  Other studies explore ways in which collection services (Ashraf, Karlan, and Yin [2006]; Dupas and Robinson [2009]) or surveys (Stango and Zinman -2010) can increase savings by acting as a shock to attention, and this can be considered a form of increased salience.  However, we\u2019re aware of no studies which aim to increase the salience of interest itself.\n\nLoss aversion is one of the cornerstones of Kahneman and Tversky\u2019s (1979) Prospect Theory, and finds \u2013 in results that have been replicated empirically in countless situations \u2013 that humans are more adversely affected by a loss than by failing to realize a gain of an equal amount.  Loss aversion\u2019s effect on savings is well-documented (Bowman, Minehart, Rabin [1999; Chua and Camerer [2003]).  However, we haven\u2019t found much literature which exploits loss aversion for the goals of development.\n\nThis experiment\u2019s aim is to evaluate an alternatively-framed savings account which draws on salience and loss aversion to \u201cnudge\u201d consumers on the margin into opening up savings accounts.  (The nature of the framed account necessitates that we study the joint effect of salience and loss aversion, so we won\u2019t be able to disentangle the individual effects of each phenomenon.)  Our incentive scheme will provide an immediate bonus to all deposits at the moment the deposit is made. However, the individuals will forfeit the benefits if they withdraw their money prior to the designated date. The amount of frontloaded benefits for any deposits will decrease as the time grows closer to the intended withdrawal date.

The ads were served on Facebook beginning on Monday, October 8, 2012 and ending Friday, October 12, 2012.  Phone interviews with treatment and control subjects began on October 13 and ended October 15.  This document was prepared prior to the launch of the survey.\n\nSubjects: Subjects are registered voters living in a state legislative district.  The campaign first supplied us with a list of voters in its district. We then generated clusters of individuals with unique ages (in buckets of two years each; e.g., \u201830-31\u2019 years old, \u201832-33\u2019, etc. all the way to a final category of \u201865 and over\u2019), genders, and cities. At the campaign\u2019s request we removed individuals under the age of 30 and over the age of 75 from the study, leaving 32,029 voters assigned to 1,220 clusters across distinct combinations of 18 age ranges, 34 towns, and 2 genders. Some potential clusters are not represented because no individual on the voter file fell into all three categories.  \n\nAssignment: We blocked clusters into groups of five based on cluster size (which ranged from one person to five hundred), then age range, then town, and finally gender. Within these groups of five clusters, we assigned two clusters to the control condition and one each to our three treatments: the name recognition appeal, the character appeal, and the policy appeal. Our procedure thus randomly assigned 32,029 identifiable individuals to online treatments (ads) within 1,220 clusters, each distinctly targetable via the Facebook ad interface.  Because the 244 blocks contain similarly sized clusters, our analysis uses difference-in-means comparisons rather than difference-in-totals (Horvitz-Thompson estimation).\n\nOutcome measurement: The calling house that conducted the survey removed duplicate phone numbers from the list we supplied, which in effect targets one voter per household.  In order to estimate the individual level ATE, we will weight by household size.  We expect these weights to have negligible effects on the results, as less than 10% of the sample is affected.\n\nAnalysis\n\nWeights.  Because the blocked random assignment gives subjects somewhat different probabilities of being assigned to a treatment, we begin by calculating the probability of treatment assignment for each subject.  Consistent estimates are obtained by weighting each observation by the inverse of its probability (IPW) of being assigned to its treatment condition.  Standard errors will be generated using randomization inference assuming constant treatment effects; this procedure will take clustered assignment (as well as blocking) into account.  These results should be closely approximated by analyses that use robust cluster standard errors and dummy variables for blocks; in order to save time, we plan to use the latter method when presenting preliminary results.\n\nOutcomes.  We plan to recode the survey responses in the following way.\n\n1.\tRecognition of the candidate vs. not.  \n2.\tOpinion of the candidate.  Our hypothesis test will use multinomial logit predicting positive, negative, vs. never heard of candidate. \n3.\tRelative opinion of the candidate vs. the opponent.  Subtract candidate\u2019s score (+1 positive, 0 no opinion, -1 negative) from the score of the opponent.  Ordered logit will be used to analyze the difference score.\n4.\tBallot heat: Ordered logit will predict preference for candidate, no preference, preference for opponent.\n5.\tAd recall: Recollection of seeing ads for the candidate online over the past week.\n\nCovariates.  The voter file contains variables that we expect to be prognostic of outcomes: party registration, age, gender, and turnout in previous elections.  In addition to presenting results without covariates, we will include these as covariates in order dampen sampling variability.  Party registration, gender, and turnout will be coded as indicator variables.  Age, age-squared, and an indicator for missing data will be used as regressors.\n\nSubgroups: We expect no treatment effect among those who report not using FB, although spillover effects from FB users are in principle possible.  Our primary analysis will be restricted to respondents who report using FB, provided that the survey reveals similar proportions reporting FB use in treatment and control.  If not, we will infer that FB reporting was primed by the preceding questions differently in treatment and control; in that case, we will estimate the CACE by dividing our ITT among all respondents by the proportion in the control group who report using FB.\n\nThe candidate deploying the ads suggested to us that larger effects are expected among older FB users, who may be more responsive to the candidate\u2019s appeals and more likely to attend to FB ads in general. This is consistent with some findings in the literature on online advertising.

Virginia jurisdictions included were Lee, Scott, Washington, and Grayson Counties and Bristol City (\u201cVA border sample\u201d).  Tennessee jurisdictions included were Johnson, Sullivan, Hawkins, Hancock, and Claiborne Counties (\u201cTN border sample\u201d).  Registered voter lists were also obtained for Knox County, TN (\u201cKnoxville sample\u201d) and Roanoke City, VA (\u201cRoanoke sample\u201d).  \n\nIn all four samples, registered voters who had voted in both the 2008 and the 2010 general elections were dropped from the study.  In the TN and VA border samples, one member of each household was then selected at random.  Unselected members were dropped from the sample.  In the TN border counties, this left a sample size of 64,205.  Of these, 21,796 were randomly selected to stay in the sample pending address verification.  In the VA border counties, this left a sample size of 34,688.  Of these, 25,000 were randomly selected to stay in the sample pending address verification.   The following STATA code, used on the VA border sample sample, illustrates the procedure by which one member of each household was selected at random and 25,000 retained for potential sample inclusion.  Analogous code was used on each other sample:\n\nset seed 3967660\ngen indivrandom=runiform()\nsort hhid indivrandom\nby hhid: keep if _n==1\nset seed 3341645\ngen indivrandom2=runiform()\nsort indivrandom2\ngenerate condition=\"To Be Assigned\" in 1/25000\ndrop if condition==\"\"\n\nIn the Knoxville and Roanoke samples, further steps were taken in order to approximate a black oversample, which was targeted to constitute 20% of each state\u2019s total sample.  \n\nIn the Knoxville sample, subjects were retained only if they resided in zip code 37914 or 37915, which were 39% black and 73% black respectively in the 2010 Census.  One member of each household was selected at random to be retained in the sample while other household members were dropped.  From among this subsample, registered voters were retained only if they resided in a precinct that had voted at least 60% for the Obama ticket in 2008.  This yielded a Knoxville sample size of 5,449.  \n\nIn the Roanoke sample, subjects were retained only if they resided in zip code 24017, which was 66% black in the 2010 Census.  One member of each household was retained at random.  Since all precincts spanning this zip code voted at least 60% for the Obama ticket in 2008, no further registered voters were dropped from the Roanoke sample.  The resulting sample size was 6,997.\n\nThe resulting list of registered voters from each sample, as well as all out-of-sample household members within the selected households were then submitted for national change of address (NCOA) processing, to be purged of subjects who had relocated.\n\nFollowing the NCOA processing, all subjects who had relocated were dropped from the analysis.\n\nRandomization\n\nRemaining registered voters within each stratum (see table below) were assigned to one of four experimental conditions.  11% were assigned to the \u201cReminder\u201d treatment, 22% each to the \u201cWarning\u201d and \u201cHelp\u201d treatments, and the remaining 45% to a control condition (no mailing).  The 4,541 subjects who remained in the Knoxville sample after NCOA, and the 4:1 Knoxville/Roanoke-to-border ratios determined the number of subjects that would be included overall in the other three samples (4,541 in Roanoke and 18,163 in each of the border samples).  Subjects randomly assigned to no experimental condition were dropped from the analysis in order to achieve these sample sizes.        \n\nAgain, code used on the post-NCOA VA border sample illustrates the randomization procedure:\n\nset seed 3967658\ngen indivrandom2=runiform()\nsort indivrandom2\ngenerate condition=. \nreplace condition = 0 in 1/8163\nreplace condition = 1 in 8164/10163\nreplace condition = 2 in 10164/14163\nreplace condition = 3 in 14164/18163\ndrop if condition==.\n\nBalance Statistics\n\nVoting history and age proved quite similar across experimental groups within each sample, suggesting that the randomization procedure was successful.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tTurnout 2008\tTurnout 2010\tAge\tN\nVA Border\t\t\t\t\n\tControl\t0.368\t0.082\t46.8\t8,163\n\tReminder\t0.384\t0.090\t47.1\t2,000\n\tWarning \t0.395\t0.081\t46.6\t4,000\n\tHelp\t0.379\t0.082\t46.8\t4,000\nTN Border\t\t\t\t\n\tControl\t0.515\t0.064\t48.7\t8,163\n\tReminder\t0.503\t0.062\t48.9\t2,000\n\tWarning \t0.518\t0.060\t49.2\t4,000\n\tHelp\t0.510\t0.064\t48.4\t4,000\nRoanoke\t\t\t\t\n\tControl\t0.469\t0.034\t45.3\t2,041\n\tReminder\t0.480\t0.035\t45.7\t500\n\tWarning \t0.502\t0.036\t45.6\t1,000\n\tHelp\t0.478\t0.031\t45.0\t1,000\nKnoxville\t\t\t\t\n\tControl\t0.536\t0.024\t45.7\t2,041\n\tReminder\t0.514\t0.023\t47.2\t500\n\tWarning \t0.503\t0.024\t47.1\t1,000\n\tHelp\t0.526\t0.025\t46.8\t1,000\n\n\nPlanned Analysis\n\nAnalysis of 2012 turnout data will consist of cross-tabs and ordinary least squares regression and will include both experimental and descriptive analyses.  A table showing turnout by experimental group within each sample will indicate whether turnout rates differed by experimental treatment.  Within each state sample (i.e. TN Border + Knoxville and VA Border + Roanoke) we will also regress turnout on dummies representing assignment to each treatment, a dummy to identify Knoxville/Roanoke (the black subsamples) from the border sample and interacting each treatment with the Knoxville/Roanoke dummy. This will be run with and without controls for turnout in the 2008 and 2010 elections.   Finally, controls for age (consisting of one dummy variable identifying voters thirty and under and a second dummy identifying voters sixty-five and older) will be added to each of these regressions, and each age dummy will be interacted with each treatment to determine whether the messages have a particularly large impact among registered voters of particular age groups.  To determine whether the effects of the mailings vary by household size and by household vote propensity composition, turnout in the experimental sample will be regressed on the treatment dummies, the Knoxville/Roanoke dummy, a variable measuring how many other registered voters reside in the same household as the voter, a variable measuring how many high-propensity registered voters (i.e. those who voted in both 2008 and 2010) reside in the household, and interactions between each treatment dummy and each of these variables.  We will also estimate the sample average treatment effect by using inverse probability weights, which take into account the different probabilities of assignment within each block.\n\nA second set of analyses will analyze within-household spillover effects.  Using the full sample of registered voters in the original lists obtained for the VA and TN border samples, and the sample of voters residing in the oversampled zip codes and precincts within the Knoxville and Roanoke samples, and eliminating subjects in the experimental sample, turnout will be regressed on a dummy identifying whether a household member received each treatment, the individual\u2019s turnout in both 2008 and 2010, and the individual\u2019s age, as well as a dummy identifying Knoxville/Roanoke subjects.  To determine whether spillover effects vary depending on the household member\u2019s baseline vote propensity, this same regression will be run with an interaction between turnout in 2008 and 2010 and the dummy identifying whether a household member received each treatment.", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "United States", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "timestamp": 41208.33023148148}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "Improving accountability in public service provision is one of the most pressing challenges that young democracies face.

The process of random assignment was as follows: A uninform random number was generated and assigned to each ED in the pool; the ED with the highest random number was selected for treatment, and contiguous EDs were deleted from the pool of eligible EDs in order to minimize spillovers; a new random number was attached to the remaining EDs, and the process was repeated until a total of 25 EDs were selected for treatment.  Notice that this procedure leads to unequal probabilities of assignment, which requires the use of inverse probability weights (see below).\n\nOutcome measurement: The calling house that conducted the survey will remove duplicate phone numbers from the list we supplied, which in effect targets one voter per household. They will also remove cell phone numbers because the first tranche of calls will be made using pre-recorded questions.

Because the assignment gives subjects somewhat different probabilities of being assigned to a treatment, we begin by calculating the probability of treatment assignment for each subject.

The program began in 2007, and operates in five of Sierra Leone's 13 districts. We are conducting a randomized controlled trial to analyze how this intervention affects individuals and communities on a wide range of outcomes including psychological wellbeing, social capital formation, economic cooperation, and conflict within the community. \n\nThe cornerstone of the Fambul Tok program is a reconciliation bonfire ceremony, which is organized to facilitate the airing of wartime grievances. Victims share their stories and perpetrators seek---and on many occasions receive---forgiveness for crimes committed during the nation's thirteen-year civil war. The ceremony is combined with traditional and religious rituals, including prayers, dancing, and a `cleansing' ceremony. The intervention is targeted at the level of a section, which are contiguous clusters of up to ten villages. Thus, several villages participate in a joint ceremony. \n\nThe program also involves a number of communal activities which are designed to build social capital and encourage community members to work together. First, the ceremony is preceded by three months of community sensitization. During this period, Fambul Tok establishes a Reconciliation Committee, through which community members and leaders work with the NGO in planning and publicizing the ceremony. In addition, Fambul Tok helps establish communal farms, where labor and output are shared, on land set aside by the community as a pledge towards reconciliation; a `Peace Tree', that provides a focal point for the community to gather and resolve disputes; and a `Peace Mothers' group, that seeks to promote women's economic activities and facilitate discussion of atrocities perpetrated during the war. \n\nThe Fambul Tok treatment could in principle have positive or negative effects. For example, it could be therapeutic for victims to share their accounts of trauma or forgive their perpetrators, which could in turn improve individual well-being, strengthen social networks with community members, lower conflict and lead to greater economic cooperation. Conversely, the reconciliation process could cause individuals to relive traumatic memories, lower their willingness to work with other villagers, and reduce their willingness to contribute to community public goods. Whether the net effect is positive or negative is an empirical question, which the field experiment aims to answer.

Since the reconciliation ceremony specifically targets individuals who were victims and perpetrators of violence, ex-combatants and those who experienced more violence during the civil war may be differentially affected by the intervention. Similarly, the program may exert varying effects by gender, both because female war experiences differed owing to factors such as gender-based violence, and because aspects of the program, such as the `Peace Mothers' group, are designed specifically to focus on women's issues. In addition, since the intervention aims to affect the community as a whole, it is plausible that entire villages that experienced higher levels of violence will respond differently to the intervention. Finally, the program's impact may differ based on the degree to which members of the village participated in the ceremony. This, in turn is likely to vary based on proximity to the ceremony location, which was almost always the section headquarter village.\n\nWe therefore test for interaction effects based on the following sub-groups:\n\n1. Ex-combatants: self-reported ex-combatants, as well as respondents who reported being abducted and made to carry a gun.\n2. Individual exposure to violence based on whether the respondent was beaten, raped, maimed, abducted; or saw violence.\n3. Village-level exposure to violence, based on the following measures:\nbuildings burned, rebel attacks, and rebel base in the village.\n4. Gender. \n5. Distance from section headquarter village.

The experimental design\nrequired half (80 sections) to receive the Fambul Tok treatment, with the\nother half acting as a control group. Sections were matched based on an optimal greedy algorithm and within pairs, assigned randomly into treatment and control status by means of a public lottery.\n\nTwo rounds of surveys were conducted in each village, a baseline prior to\nthe intervention and an endline after the intervention.

The section-pair fixed effects account for section-level matching in the allocation of treatment.

political parties is to recruit citizens to run for office.  In the United States, there is great variation in the extent to which local and state party organizations are involved in recruitment (Sanbonmatsu 2006).  And, should parties be interested in recruitment, there is little empirical understanding about what the most effective recruitment messages are.  This field experiment seeks to fill that hole by testing which recruitment messages are most effective at activating the latent political ambitions of party members.\n\nBeyond a general interest in recruitment, we are also interested in effective messages to recruit underrepresented populations, specifically women and members of the working class.  Women are significantly underrepresented in political office. Existing research suggests that one of the most significant factors in this underrepresentation is that women show less ambition for political office than men (Fox and Lawless 2010). After significant field research on the recruitment patterns of American state political party organizations, Sanbonmatsu finds that \u201cwomen's initial decision to run for office is more likely than men's to involve recruitment\u201d by a political party (2006, 27).  \n\nMembers of the working class are also severely underrepresented in politics (Carnes 2013).  Almost all of this underrepresentation happens before the general election stage.  Consequently, uncovering the messages that activate the latent political ambitions of working-class citizens may offer clues about why there are so few working-class politicians and how parties can recruit more, should they desire to do so.  \n\nWe test existing theories about what inhibits political ambition by randomly assigning subjects to receiving one of eleven invitations in the mail to a party-sponsored \u201cProspective Candidate Information Seminar\u201d (PCIS).

The former reflect anticipated social sanctions (rewards, punishments, approval or rejection by others) and concerns for reputation and social standing, while the latter describe intrinsic motivations for pro- or anti-social behavior, such as altruism, fairness, spitefulness, etc. The study consists of three components: (1) Estimating the average effect of social incentives on cooperation in public goods and accountability dilemmas in a cross section of villages through an experimental study, (2) exploring different causal mechanisms that could explain heterogeneity in individuals\u2019 responses to social incentives, (3) using village-level average effects of social incentives in different social dilemma scenarios as a measure of decentral social norm enforcement capacity in the village and testing whether variation in decentral enforcement capacity across villages can explain differences in village-level governance quality and collective action capacity among villages within the same district. \n\nThe experiments use a within-subject design in which each study participant takes part in one of three interactive behavioral games in four treatment conditions: Anonymously in a group of covillagers, anonymously in a group of strangers from different villages, in a group of co-villagers where participants are identifiable by name ex-post, and in a group of strangers where participants are identifiable by name ex-post.

The study critically examines whether the existing body of evidence from laboratory experiments holds up in field settings. \n\nHypothesis 1.1: On average, social incentives lead to more pro-social behavior in cooperation and accountability dilemmas among covillagers.\n\nB.\tHeterogeneity of treatment effects\n\nPlausible causal mechanisms are thinkable that could lead to a rejection of or a null finding on Hypothesis 1.1 if social incentives have contrary effects across different subsets of the population. These mechanisms are investigated by exploring heterogeneity in responses to social incentives across individuals. Details are provided in a separate research design document. \n\nB.1 Potential causes of adverse effects of social incentives on pro-social behavior\n\nPotential mechanisms that could explain adverse effects of social incentives on pro-social behavior: \n(1)\tCompensating differential: If social sanctions are not strong enough to impose prohibitive costs on norm violators, less vulnerable individuals may increase selfish behavior up to a point that compensates them for the anticipated sanctions and reputational consequences of violating a social norm. \n(2)\tFear of anti-social punishment or perverse sanctioning behavior, especially fear of raising suspicion. \n(3)\tAdverse incentives arising from risk-sharing and redistribution practices within villages. \n(4)\tSocial rewards for self-interested behavior\n\nB.2 Social integration and social vulnerability as sources of heterogeneity\n\nIt will be assessed whether individuals\u2019 position in the village-level social network can explain heterogeneous effects of social incentives within villages. Details are described in the research design document.  \n\nB.3 Other sources of heterogeneity\n\nExisting claims in the literature about the effects of social position, migrant status, and cultural differences on pro-social behavior among co-villagers will be re-evaluated on the data from this study and it will be assessed whether these results, if they can be replicated, can be attributed to the effect of social incentives. \n\nC.\tVillage-level comparisons\n\nThe second research question to be addressed by this study is whether decentral enforcement capacity in a village can explain why the quality of village-level governance varies across otherwise similar villages within the same administrative district in rural Tanzania. The village-level average effect of social incentives on cooperation and accountability in the individual-level experiments is used as a measure of decentral enforcement capacity in the villlage. The following primary hypotheses are tested: \n\nHypothesis 2.1: There is a positive relationship between the average effect of social incentives on contributions in the public goods game and village-level collective action capacity, conditional on the village-level average contributions in the stranger/anonymous condition of the public goods game. \n\nHypothesis 2.2: There is a positive relationship between the average effect of social incentives on public goods provision in the accountability game and village-level governance outcomes, conditional on the village-level average contribution decisions in the stranger/anonymous condition of the public goods game and the average proposed appropriation of group resources in the stranger/anonymous condition of the group sharing game. \n\nAdditionally, the village-level comparisons aim to test the conjecture that external and internal enforcement of cooperation and compliance with rules in the village are substitutes and that external enforcement is inefficient compared to internal enforcement. The prediction is that the greater a community's ability to enforce norms and contributions decentrally, the less will the village government rely on external enforcement. \n\nHypothesis 2.3: There is a negative relationship between decentral enforcement capacity in a village (measured as the average effect of social incentives on contributions in the public goods game)\n and the village government's reliance on external enforcement, conditional on contributions in the stranger/anonymous condition.", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Do Social Incentives Favor or Inhibit Cooperation and Accountability in Tanzanian Villages?", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Lierl", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Researchers", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "Hypothesis 1.1 will be tested by estimating the interaction effect of the covillager and ex-post identifiability treatments on subjects' decisions in each of the three experiments. Given the dependency of observations across treatments within subjects and across subjects within villages, this quantity of interest will be estimated through a multi-level mixed-effects regression of the decisions in the behavioral games on the covillager and ex-post-identifiability treatments and their interaction term, clustered by village and subject. Predictors for subject-specific random effects will include age, gender, and a measure of risk aversion (the subject's decision in a lottery choice game). While the order of the treatments is fully randomized within subjects and will therefore not bias the coefficient estimates, it may nonetheless be the case that order effects are responsible for a substantive part of the variability in the data, in which case it would be efficient to also control for whether an observation stems from a subject's second, third or fourth game may be included. If inspection of the data suggests that the sharing decisions (contributions in the public goods games, or sharing proposals in the other two games) are censored at zero and 100%, then a multi-level mixed-effects Tobit model would be the most appropriate specification. Hypothesis 1.1 would be rejected by a significant negative coefficient on the interaction term of the covillager and ex-post identifiability treatments and would be confirmed by a significant positive coefficient. If the coefficient is not significantly different from zero, the result would be inconclusive.\n\nHeterogeneity of the within-subject effects will be analyzed using a series of regressions with the within-subject effects as dependent variable and the respective individual characteristics as explanatory variables.\n\nHypotheses 2.1 \u2013 2.3 will be tested through regressions of the respective village-level observational outcome measures on the village-level average effect of social incentives on individuals\u2019 decisions in the relevant behavioral experiments.

But how do we attract high quality citizens to run for public office? How do we nudge good politicians?\n\nA dominant paradigm in the modern political economy literature builds on the idea that incentives matter. Incentives such as high wage or prestige of being in office attract a pool of high quality candidates. The problem, however, is that incentives that attract good politicians also work to attract bad ones. \n\nIn a world with perfect information where good types can be distinguished from bad types, the policymaker can simply target incentives to good types to nudge them to run for office. Unfortunately, we are in a world where bad politicians pretend to be good types. In other words, the policymaker is confronted with the problem of adverse selection. Without any mechanism that can screen-in good citizens and selectively nudge them to run for public office, incentives would be implemented inefficiently.\n\n\nA Theory of Screening\n\nIn this research study, I evaluate a policy intervention in which good politicians can be screened-in, and hence be selectively incentivized to run for office. The idea is very much in the spirit of the game theoretic model of schooling as a screening device. I propose a mechanism\u2014instead of schooling, a workshop\u2014in which aspiring politicians will be given an incentive, but conditional on performing well in the workshop (i.e. conditional on being able to signal that they are \"high quality\" candidates). Using randomized field experiment, I show that this mechanism can selectively nudge high quality citizens to run for office. In short, I propose to evaluate a policy intervention that systematically nudges good politicians. \n\n\nThe Experimental Design\n\nThe design of the field experiment is as follows. Before a scheduled election, call for applications will be sent out to citizens who are contemplating on running for an elective office. The call for application is for an all-expense-paid workshop that would equip participants with knowledge and leadership skills useful in campaigning and in policymaking. There will be limited slots and so interested participants will be informed that selection is not guaranteed but that everybody will have an equal chance of being selected. \n\nThere will be a pre-workshop session in which selected applicants will be asked to take a baseline survey and undergo a series of tests. The tests, in particular, will measure \"quality\" such as aptitude (measured by a test of memory for digit span), personality trait (measured by Big Five Inventory), motivational profile (measured by Perry's 1996 scale of Public Service Motivation), and aspiration (measured by Kasser and Ryan's 1993 aspiration index). Additionally, I will measure the ratio of the length of the index and ring fingers (also called the \"digit ratio\") as proxy for biologically determined factors of altruism and pro-social behavior.\n\nAfter the pre-workshop session, respondents will then be randomly assigned into three experimental groups: a Control Group (A), a Workshop with Conditional Incentive Treatment Group (B), and a Workshop with Unconditional Incentive Treatment Group (C).\n\nParticipants in the Control Group (A) will not be invited to the workshop and will not receive any further intervention. They will act as the counterfactual, the \"business-as-usual\" group.\n\nThose assigned to the treatment groups B and C, on the other hand, will be invited to attend a workshop. However, none of them will be informed of any incentives at the time of the invitation, to prevent differential take-up across these two treatment arms.\n\nIn the workshop, participants will attend different sessions in which their output and performance will be monitored and scored. If the screening theory is correct, then \"high quality\" participants (e.g. those who have high aptitude, more altruistic, have high public service motivation, etc.) should be delivering quality outputs and performing better than their counterparts.\n\nIf a participant is assigned in Treatment Group B (workshop with conditional incentive), then he/she will receive an incentive at the end of the workshop only if he/she makes the pre-determined cutoff score. On the other hand, if he/she is assigned in Treatment Group C (workshop with unconditional incentive), then he/she will receive an incentive regardless of his/her score.\n\nThe incentive is a combo of two things: (1) a certificate of merit to be awarded during the closing ceremony of the workshop, and, (2) should the incentive recipients decide to subsequently run for an elective office, the sponsoring partner organization shall donate 5 pieces of campaign posters to them. In other words, the incentive is designed to lower the cost of campaigning (since the recipient will receive 5 pieces of free campaign posters), and to increase the psychic benefit of running for office (for example, because the recipient may view it as a fruit of their hard work during the workshop.).\n\n\nOutcomes of Interest\n\nThe main outcomes of interest are: (1) subjects' subsequent decision to run or not run for office, (2) conditional on filing an official certificate of candidacy, their vote-share margin of victory, (3) a binary variable for winning the elective seat, and (4) conditional on winning an elective seat, subsequent performance in office measured in several ways including session attendance, legislations passed, projects delivered, funds raised, among others.\n\n\t\nNudging Good Politicians: The Composition of Those Who Run for Office, Those Who Win, and Those Who Perform in Office\n\nI am interested in measuring the effect of the treatments on the composition of those who choose to run for office, those who win, and those who perform while in office. If the screening theory is correct, I only expect treatment group B to work in selectively nudging high quality citizens to run for office, win office, and perform well in office, where quality is measured by their baseline characteristics (i.e. memory for digit span, public sector motivation, digit ratio, aspiration, and personality). Because the incentive in treatment group B is only given conditional on making the workshop performance scores cutoff, and because \u2018high quality\u2019 respondents are more likely to make the cutoff (given that effort is less costly to them), then the mechanism works to selectively incentivize high quality citizens. In effect, this causes better outcomes on average in this group relative to the other experimental groups, A and C. \n\n\nPractical Considerations\n\nA foremost practical concern of my research project is how to identify the population of interest \u2013 these aspiring political candidates. It is virtually impossible to find a group of political amateurs who would be willing to participate in a large-n experimental study in which some of them are randomly assigned into being exposed to a workshop described above. \n\nI look to a particular and germane political setting to implement this proposed field experiment - my country, the Philippines. The Philippines is by far the only country in the world that popularly elects youth representatives to its smallest political unit\u2014the barangay (village). Each of the 42,000+ barangays in the country is mandated by law (under the Local Government Code of 1991) to establish a Sangguniang Kabataan (SK), a governing body comprised of youth aged 15 to 17 years old. Crucially for my proposed research project, the SK is a low-stakes public office (both in terms of remuneration and in scope of responsibilities) and it often serves as a jump-off point for a political career for aspiring politicians. Therefore, their group offers an apt opportunity to implement my proposed policy intervention.\n\nIn anticipation of the upcoming Barangay level elections in October 28, 2013, I plan to implement my proposed field experiment beginning August 1, 2013.\n\n\nTheoretical Innovation\n\nIncentives can be inefficient because of adverse selection. Designing a mechanism in which incentives are given conditional on being able to signal type can be Pareto-improving. The theoretical innovation is in applying the logic of screening to the task of incentivizing high quality citizens into running for public office.\n\n\nEmpirical Contributions\n\nThis paper is a first attempt to provide experimental measure of incentive effect in the literature on political elite behavior and selection. It is also a first attempt to systematically show that workshop/training acts as a screening device outside of private sector labor markets. Additionally, it is a first attempt to correlate objective measures of quality with political selection in an experimental setting, and a first attempt to provide systematic experimental evidence that confirms/debunks what we know about political selection, i.e., bad types have the comparative advantage into entering politics.\n\n\nBroad Policy Implications\n\nIncentives work, but incentives conditional on being able to signal quality work better.\n\nThere is room for private and nonprofit organizations to design programs that can screen-in good politicians and raise the quality of the political class at the onset of their careers.\n\nPolitical incentives - campaign donations, political endorsements, pecuniary and non-pecuniary incentives while in office - can be made contingent on signal of politician's ability.", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "id": "20130819AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "Please see answer below.", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Nudging Good Politicians", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Ravanilla", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Researchers", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "Main specification:\n\noutcome_i = b0 + b1*conditional_i + b2*unconditional_i + b3*conditional_i*quality_i + b4*unconditional_i*quality_i + b5*quality_i + e_i\n\noutcome_i:\n          run_i = 1 if filed official certificate of candidacy after intervention,  otherwise\n          cmv_i = candidate's vote-share margin of victory\n          win_i = 1 if conditional on being a candidate, won election, 0 otherwise\n          performance_i = conditional on winning an elective seat, various measures of performance in office including session attendance, legislations passed, projects delivered, funds raised, among others\n\nquality_i:\n          high_ds_i = 1 if scored in the 50th percentile of test of memory for digit span, 0 otherwise\n          aspiration_i = index of aspiration (Kasser and Ryan's)\n          personality_i = index of personality (Big Five)\n          motivation_i = index of motivational profile (Perry's)\n          digit_ratio_i = digit ratio\n\nconditional_i = 1 if attended workshop with conditional incentive, 0 otherwise\nunconditional_i = 1 if attended workshop with unconditional incentive, 0 otherwise\n\nHypotheses:\n\nb0 > 0 (agnostic, expect positive)\nb1 < 0 -> low quality individuals screened-out\nb2 > 0 -> low quality individuals are adversely incentivized\nb3 > 0 -> high quality individuals screened-in and incentivized\nb4 > 0 -> high quality individuals unconditionally incentivized\nb5 < 0 (agnostic, expect negative, i.e. high quality individuals in control group have worse outcomes on average)\n\n [(b3-b1) - (b4-b2)] > 0 -> workshop with conditional incentive works as a screening device, relative to workshop with unconditional incentive.

Costas Panagopolous (2013a, 2013b) has twice found implicit social pressure effectively and significantly raises turnout using a set of eyes located prominently on a generic civic duty GOTV mailer as an implicit social pressure cue. There is considerable work in social psychology finding that when people believe they are being watched they act in more socially appropriate manners.  This is true even for cases where the watching is not being done by another human being but simply by a picture or a postcard. Subconsciously the mind registers the gaze of a set of eyes and it impacts behavior. This effect has been found to significantly increase contributions to lunch room coffee funds and to cleaning up in cafeterias.  Panagopolous has found placing a set of eyes prominently on a standard GOTV mailer with a civic message increases turnout significantly above the effect of getting the same GOTV mailer with an American flag.  He has found this effect in two different places: Florida and Kentucky.\n\nIn an initial replication test we used a similar, but not identical, mailer in the El Paso, Texas mayor\u2019s race in June, 2013.

We predicted the male eyes would have a greater effect than the female eyes in El Paso and we maintain that prediction.  Otherwise the message is a generic GOTV message adjusted so it is virtually identical to the message Panagopoulos used in his successful attempts (this is a change from our initial El Paso message).\n\nWe will be testing these GOTV mailers in 4 to 7 sites across the country identified based on distinct political cultures (Elazar\u2019s model).

This is because poor countries tend, by most accounts, to have more clientelism. However, this hypothesis ignores a possible confound\u2014the credibility of politicians running for office. Young democracies, in general, tend to be both poorer\u2014as a vast number of democratization studies have shown us\u2014and also have newer politicians and political parties. Parties and politicians without track records could be especially risky propositions for voters. As a rule, what a candidate \u201csays in today\u2019s campaign is an uncertain guide to his actions after he takes office,\u201d as Enelow and Munger (1993) put it. Without track records, campaign promises become even more uncertain guides to post-election behavior. \n\nDrawing from Downs (1957) and spatial theory, Enelow and Munger conceptualize credibility as a type of reliability, which they define as a measure of whether policy statements made during a campaign can be used to predict post-election policy. This definition of the credibility of a politician is similar to the social psychology literature\u2019s conception of source credibility, which has been long associated with expertise and trustworthiness (see, for instance, a vast literature including Hovland and Weiss, 1951; Dholakia and Sternthal 1977; Wiener and Mowen, 1986; and Pornpitakpan, 2004, among many others). According to Pornpitakpan, expertise refers to the \u201cextent to which a speaker is perceived to be capable of making correct assertions\u201d whereas trustworthiness refers to \u201cthe degree to which an audience perceives the assertions made by a communicator to be ones that the speaker considers valid\u201d (244). \n\nOn one hand, as one group of scholars has hypothesized (see Keefer and Vlaicu, 2008; Robinson and Verdier, 2013; Hanusch and Keefer, 2012), a politician can overcome this \u201ccredibility deficit\u201d through long-term investments in building up a reputation of trustworthiness and expertise, which can be established by expending resources to reach out to voters, keeping his word, pursuing sound policies, and allowing voters to monitor their performance. However, this strategy requires integrity, skill, luck, and most importantly, time. On the other hand, a politician can also close this credibility deficit by outsourcing the task to an intermediary who already has credibility in a given population (relying on local-level patrons) and by supplying resources to these patrons and voters before the election even happens (buying votes). \n\nThis latter strategy could be especially effective in many cases, according to the high-discount-rate view of clientelism. Those who subscribe to this view state that voters\u2014especially poor ones\u2014are extremely skeptical of the value of promised programs when they are voting because they are uncertain that these programs will actually come into being and/or will actually help them in practice. In other words, they expect to receive much fewer benefits from programs in actuality than the politician promoting them promises. As such, voters are often willing to decide their votes on the basis of minor gifts given to them before the election rather than a candidate\u2019s policy promises (see, for example, Brusco, Nazareno and Stokes, 2004; Scott, 1969). \n\nThis situation relates directly to Latin America, especially Brazil, which has seen a rapid decrease in clientelist practices (e.g., vote buying and patronage) in the North and Northeast over the past ten years, as Brazilian democracy has become more established and its parties and politicians (especially Luiz In\u00e1cio \u201cLula\u201d da Silva and his Partido dos Trabalhadores) have established a certain degree of credibility. In other words, these scholars would argue that politicians had to rely on intermediaries and clientelism to overcome a credibility deficit in the North and Northeast when Brazil was a young democracy, but that certain left-wing programmatic (policy-oriented, as opposed to clientelism- or patronage-oriented) politicians, such as Lula, were able to eventually establish solid reputations of expertise and trustworthiness after a certain amount of time. Once politicians like Lula were able to establish credibility, they were able to compete with clientelist parties in the North and Northeast, leading to clientelism\u2019s decline in these areas. \n\nThe problem, however, is that even if Lula and his party gained a significant amount of credibility over the last ten years, a number of other things also happened at the same time that could also have led to a decline in clientelism in North and Northeast Brazil. For instance, an increase in the credibility of parties\u2019 programmatic promises coincided with a rise in income among nordestinos (northeasterners), which might, in turn, have led to an increase in the credibility of the parties\u2019 policy promises. As such, many possible causes could be endogenous to one another, making it very difficult to disentangle these causes from one another and determine which one explains the most. \n\nAs a result, I intend to determine whether credibility makes voters more likely to select programmatic options experimentally manipulating the credibility (or reliability, in Enelow and Munger\u2019s words) of a hypothetical political candidate and seeing whether this manipulation affects voters\u2019 willingness to support a programmatic candidate.", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "id": "20131105AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "My dependent variable is the likelihood that a given voter votes for a given political candidate (the candidate whose credibility will be varied during the experiment).

After indicating consent, the survey would continue to a page where they would be asked questions to ascertain their eligibility to vote. If the respondent fulfilled the eligibility requirements for voting, then he/she would go to the first prompt.\n\nThe first group will be a control group. The first prompt would introduce a hypothetical situation in which respondents would have to vote for the mayor of Austin out of two fictitious options. Upon indicating that he/she had read the prompt, the respondent would then advance to a page with two blocks of text. On one half of the screen would be a piece of text explaining that one candidate has stated that he feels that public transportation services are important for Austin and would make improving them his number one priority in office. In other words, this candidate would make a neutral pledge without any indication of either credibility or a lack thereof. On the other half of the screen would appear text indicating that the second candidate was promising to implement a bus fare policy that he says would save the respondent $10 per month if he was elected. The order in which these candidates are shown would be randomized (i.e., it would be random which candidate would be Candidate A and which candidate would be Candidate B). The respondent would then select who he/she would vote for. After the treatment was assigned, several other questions would be asked to the participants. These questions will include basic demographic questions, which will be used to measure whether true randomization occurred. They will also include a series of questions measuring the respondents\u2019 perceptions of corruption in government. The answers to these questions will be used to evaluate the second hypothesis of whether increases in respondents\u2019 perceptions of the pervasiveness of corruption in their government makes them value candidates\u2019 credibility more.

It turns out, in fact, that he was able to successfully implement the scheme and that it did actually save everyone in the town an average of $10/month. This would be used as an indicator of credibility\u2014this candidate\u2019s pre-campaign promises were good predictors of his post-election behavior. As such, it could also be inferred that his pre-election promises in this campaign are also good predictors of post-election policy (in other words, that he has credibility as a candidate). The respondent would then select who he/she would vote for. After the treatment was assigned, several other questions would be asked to the participants. These questions will include basic demographic questions and a series of questions measuring the respondents\u2019 perceptions of corruption in government. Afterwards, the participants would be debriefed, compensated, and thanked for their time.\n\nThe third group will be a second treatment group.  The participants will receive the same prompt as the control group, but with an additional line stating that the candidate offering the bus fare policy had been mayor of another town before moving to Austin, and had promised to implement the same scheme in that other town during his campaign to be mayor. It turns out, in fact, that he was not able to successfully implement his scheme. This would be used as an indicator of a lack of credibility\u2014this candidate\u2019s pre-campaign promises were not good predictors of his post-election policy in the past and therefore should not be expected to be good predictors of post-election behavior in this election. The respondent would then select who he/she would vote for. After the treatment was assigned, several other questions would be asked to the participants.

However, to evaluate my second hypothesis, I will use a binary logit model given that I will have two relevant independent variables and a binary dependent variable (whether a given respondent votes for a candidate or not). If the coefficient for my treatment variable (\u03b2_1, or credibility) is significant (i.e., p<.05), then I will conclude that I have support for my first hypothesis (that increases in candidates\u2019 credibility enhance the likelihood that a given voter will vote for them). Likewise, if the coefficient for my interaction variable between credibility and perceptions of corruption (\u03b2_3) is significant (p<.05), I will conclude that there is support for my second hypothesis (that increases in credibility especially affect the voting decisions of voters who believed that their government was corrupt).", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "Brazil", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "timestamp": 41583.63815972222}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "Please see attached document.", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "id": "20131110AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "Please see attached document.", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Supporting Traditional Leaders to Mitigate Community-Level Conflict", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Baldwin, Mvukiyehe", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "IRC", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "Please see attached document.", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "Zimbabwe", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "timestamp": 41588.92912037037}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "id": "20131117AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "\u201cNetwork Effects on Political Participation: Evidence from Mozambique\u201d", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Vicente, Humphreys", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "Mozambique", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "timestamp": "11/17/2013"}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "Motivation: The purpose of this survey experiment (and a brief second experiment) is to test how constitutional transgressions shape public attitudes and how these attitudes are mitigated or altered by the political arguments that the ruling ANC party regularly makes. My overarching hypothesis is that citizens in South Africa, including ANC supporters, object to constitutional transgressions, but that the ANC\u2019s political arguments are effective in preventing these objections from significantly undermining ANC support. As a result, important political events that erode institutional procedures prescribed in the constitution, most pertinently the Arms Deal and aftermath, can occur without significant political damage for the ANC. This dynamic is dangerous for a new democracy, because institutional erosion, once set in motion, is difficult to reverse. It is therefore important to understand better the role that public accountability plays on procedural issues at the constitutional level.\n\nResearch Design: Respondents will receive one of three \u201cconstitutional treatments\u201d (C1, C2, C3) and one of three \u201cpolitical treatments\u201d (P1, P2, P3) that are real events based on the South African \u201cArms Deal\u201d (a set of military purchases that involved high level bribes and then years of institutional oversight battles) that were reported in the news. Respondents will simply be told that these events were reported in the news \u2013 there will be some questions afterward about if they were familiar with the scenarios and if they believed they were accurate as well as questions to test their knowledge of the events and understanding of the experimental manipulation. Real events are used to maximize external validity. Combining the two types of treatments, there are a total of 9 randomly assigned treatment groups:\n\tP1\tP2\tP3\nC1\t1.\tC1P1\t4. C1P2\t7. C1P3\nC2\t2.\tC2P1\t5. C2P2\t8. C2P3\nC3\t3.\tC3P1\t6. C3P2\t9. C3P3\n\nFurther, all treatment groups will then be asked if they perceived a constitutional violation and then get a \u201cpersuasion treatment\u201d (C4) that asks them to reconsider under the assumption that the Constitutional Court of South Africa (CCSA) ruled otherwise to see if this has any effect on their evaluations of ANC actions.\n \nThe dependent variable is support for the ANC \u201cwhen it acts this way\u201d measured by degree of approval (strong or weak) and how people feel about the party on a temperature scale. My primary analysis will be conducted using OLS, adjusting for pretreatment covariates for race, ANC support (measured in a randomized list of parties), home language, age, and class. For simplicity, in stating my tests below I refer to the OLS measure of the treatment effect as the \u201cdifference\u201d between treatments. The sample will be roughly N=1200-1600 from between 10 and 20 sites around Johannesburg. While this is far from a nationally representative sample, it should be high in ANC supporters, which is of primary concern, and include variation in both socio-economic class and how people identify (race, ethnicity, or nationally) which are explanatory variables for two secondary hypotheses with a reasonable expectation of sufficient power. Respondents will be selected by going house to house and in public spaces (to ensure variation) using randomized selection patterns. \n\nConstitutional Treatments: C1 describes a decision from the Arms Deal and indicates that corruption may have been involved. It is intended to capture the idea of corruption from the Arms Deal without any procedural transgressions of the event. C2 includes the statement from C1 and then adds a description of implicit constitutional transgression. Based on theoretical arguments developed elsewhere in the dissertation, the action is a transgression because it undermines the meaning of institutional authorities conferred by the constitution by signaling that the ruling party is not subject to those authorities. However, C2 does not say that the action was against the constitution, so it is implicit. C3 includes statements C1 and C2 but then says that the action violated the constitution, hence it is an explicit transgression. C1, C2 and C3 are all statements that summarize what has been stated in various news reports; while they are put in simple terms, there is no deception involved. \n\nPolitical Treatments: P1 is a control with no political treatment. P2 and P3 are drawn from political arguments that Jacob Zuma made in his Freedom Day speech in April 2013. They include one statement of fact and one persuasive statement by the ANC. The first one (P2) is the most common ANC political argument, emphasizing economic improvement and leadership of the liberation struggle. The second one (P3) is the ANC\u2019s common response to accusations of corruption or transgression.", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "id": "20131118AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "Hypotheses:\n\nH1: Citizens are less likely to approve of ANC actions and will feel \u201ccolder/less favorable\u201d about the ANC as a result of considering information about a constitutional transgression (i.e constitutional transgression marginally significant in the absence of political arguments). \n\nH1a: The effect in H1 is likely to be greater/smaller if citizens consider that the CCSA held that the events did/didn\u2019t violate the constitution, contrary to the initial view of the respondent (in other words, citizens will find the CCSA persuasive and care about that). \n\nH2: Citizens are more likely to approve of ANC actions and will feel \u201cwarmer/more favorable\u201d about the ANC as a result of ANC political arguments after considering ANC corruption and constitutional transgressions compared to when they do not hear those arguments (i.e ANC political arguments are marginally effective across constitutional treatments). \n\nH3: Attitudes of disapproval toward constitutional transgressions (tested in H1) will be eliminated by ANC political arguments (i.e effectiveness of ANC political arguments interact with constitutional transgression).\n\nH3a: Attitudes of disapproval toward implicit constitutional transgressions will be eliminated by ANC political arguments. \n\nH3b: Attitudes of disapproval toward explicit constitutional transgression will be mitigated by ANC political arguments. \n\nH4: Those who have an instrumental attachment to rule of law due to economic activity are more likely to care about procedural violations of the constitution.

Approximately 1,500 individuals in California ordered signs opposing fracking from a California political group. Half of these individuals were randomized to a treatment group that received the signs on Wednesday, November 20, 2013 while the remaining half will not receive the signs until the second week of December. Data on residents of the 40 closest households to each of the 1,500 sign orderers were obtained from TargetSmart Communications and an automated script was used to identify which of these households would likely be exposed to the signs if they were placed in the proximate yard. Phone interviews with these households subjects began on Saturday, November 30.  This document was prepared prior to the completion of the first day of surveying, before any data was examined.\n\nSubjects: Subjects are registered voters living in California near a person who had ordered a yard sign. A group first supplied us with the addresses of 1,500 people who had ordered yard signs opposing fracking. A Python script relying on the Google Maps API identified the route each of the 40 closest households would take to drive to their city center from their house and retained households in the sample if this route took them within 120 feet of the center of the proximate house that ordered the sign.\n\nAssignment: We first clustered signs together that were within \u00bd a mile of each other to form clusters of signs (to limit spillover). We then blocked clusters together into blocks of size 2 using BlockTools, blocking on the sign's latitude and longitude. Random assignment was conducted within these blocks using R's sample() function.\n\nOutcome measurement: The calling house that conducted the survey attempted to secure one survey response per household that we had ex ante identified as likely to see the signs (see above).\n\nAnalysis\n\nOutcomes: We plan to recode the survey responses in the following way.\nSupport for a ban on fracking.\n7 - Strongly support\n6 - Not so strongly support\n5 - Lean towards favoring\n4 - No opinion\n3 - Lean towards opposing\n2 - Not so strongly oppose\n1 - Strongly oppose\nImportance of fracking as an issue\n1-5 scale\n\u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d response recoded as 1, not at all important\nPerception of neighborhood support for ban on fracking\n5 - Almost everyone\n4 - Most\n3 - Some\n2 - A few\n1 - Almost no one\nRecord \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d as 1\nYard sign recall\n2- Yes\n1- Not sure / Don\u2019t know\n0- No\n\nEstimation: For preliminary results we will use the difference-in-means estimator with standard errors generated by randomization inference. For the final article we will employ an estimator not sensitive to relationships between cluster size and potential outcomes using cluster totals.\n\nCovariates:  The voter file contains variables that we expect to be prognostic of outcomes: party registration, gender, and age. Party affiliation will be measured with a survey question for individuals who cannot be conclusively identified. In addition to presenting results without covariates, we will include these as covariates in order dampen sampling variability.  Party registration and gender will be coded as indicator variables.  Age, age-squared, and an indicator for missing data will be used as regressors.\n\nSubgroup effects: We plan to test for the following two heterogenous treatment effects:\nThe treatment effect of the sign will be larger for households that live closer to the sign.\nThe treatment effect of the sign will be larger for people who have voted in more previous elections (proxy for political information levels).\nThe treatment effect of the sign will be larger in regions of California where average yard sign issue importance is higher.", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "id": "20131130AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": " \u201cDescriptive Norms and Issue Support: A Field Experiment with Yard Signs\u201d", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Broockman, Green", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Researchers", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "see above", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "United States", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "timestamp": 41608.729097222225}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "id": "20131203AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Measuring the Effect of Coethnicity on Political and Economic Attitudes: Experimental Evidence from Northern Benin\u201c", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Adida, Lo, Verink ", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "Benin", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "timestamp": "12/3/2013"}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "IRB approval is in progress.

Such information can be used by citizens to take actions to protect themselves from such dangers, and possibly to support policies that would help to mitigate the consequences of those risks. Because public officials generally cannot provide individualized assessments of risk, they are routinely faced with a fundamental choice: present information that suggests that risks are universal across all individuals in the community, or make key distinctions about the relative risks across particular groups. The latter is often a preferred strategy among public health officials in particular because it is thought to lead to more efficient targeting of prevention modalities to the subsets of the population where the problem is most prevalent.\nIn our research, we raise the question of whether it is always a good idea to communicate risks in terms of group differences, particularly if the goal is to raise the perception of risk among the most vulnerable groups, and to get members of those groups to take actions to mitigate those dangers, and to support related public policies. Our concerns are rooted in a theoretical appreciation for the social construction of risk perception, and the powerful implications of intergroup conflict:\nAlthough many everyday dangers are well understood by local experts and policy-makers, a long line of research has demonstrated quite convincingly that how individuals perceive risks is far from straightforward: risk perception is not merely a function of cold, hard facts concerning the prevalence of certain dangers within a population. An obvious example is the extent to which many individuals fear flying because of the associated dangers, but express little fear -- presumably perceiving less intense risks of danger -- \u00acwhen it comes to driving an automobile, a far more dangerous activity. As several scholars have convincingly explained, perceptions of and responses to \u201cobjective\u201d dangers tend to deviate from economic notions of expected utility (Kahneman and Tversky 1979; Douglas 1992; Slovic 1999; Slovic et. al. 2004). And Nathanson (1996: 611) goes on to argue that, \u201cadoption and implementation of public health policies require culturally credible constructions of risk to the public\u2019s health.\u201d \nAlong these lines, we raise the possibility that group-differentiated messages about particular dangers might actually have unintended consequences leading to risk denialism. We raise this concern based on a recognition that intergroup relations may strongly affect individual risk perceptions, particularly when a given danger carries negative social connotations -- i.e., some form of social stigma. Theoretically, we draw on a series of insights from social psychology (i.e. Tajfel 1971; Brewer, 2007; Dunham 2011), which emphasize the consequences of intergroup conflict for cognitions and behavior. Of particular relevance for our purposes is the consistent finding associated with social identity theory (SIT) that individuals will use group heuristics to interpret new information, which in turn biases how they process information, and their associated attitudes and behaviors. Moreover, individuals strive to develop and to maintain a positive self-image and they will use and protect their group identity to that end (Tajfel and Turner 1986). While usually discussed in terms of \u201cself-enhancing\u201d effects such as preferring the ingroup, the same broad motivation should also lead group members to downplay or to deny information that paints their group in a negative light, for example by impugning its reliability or simply not attending to it as fully. \nSpecifically, if information about a given danger is presented in a group-differentiated manner, and has been framed (explicitly, or through previous socialization) as a stigmatized condition, individual members of the group identified as being at higher risk are likely to engage in efforts to distance themselves from the threatening portrayal of their group, and thereby protect themselves from the stigmatizing information. Two primary strategies are available: To distance themselves from the group itself, i.e. to disidentify, or to discredit the threatening information, i.e., to engage in denialism. In the case of salient, personally meaningful social identities such as those connected with race and ethnicity, disidentification will often not be an available strategy. Thus, we anticipate that denialism will be the more common response to this kind of identity threat. \nFollowing the same logic, we expect that members of the group identified as being at lower risk of a stigmatized condition (and particularly those individuals who strongly identify with the group), are likely to more positively assess the reliability of the framing information precisely because it deflects the stigmatized risk away from their own group. This also can be interpreted in terms of identity maintenance, in that it also corresponds to perceiving their own risks as being very low.", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "id": "20131211AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "Hypotheses:\nBased on this theoretical set-up, our hypotheses pertain to subject populations in which three key conditions hold: there exist identifiable groups within the subject population who engage in a degree of intergroup conflict; there exists a substantial danger that is stigmatized; and there exists credible data suggesting that the danger is more prevalent in one group as compared with the other -- and we subsequently refer to those groups respectively as high-danger (HD) and low-danger (LD). Such conditions are routinely met in the real world, and as we will discuss, we take up a real-world problem, but future research could induce such conditions in an experimental context. \nPrimarily, our research seeks to test the three-way interaction between group identity, the framing of the danger in terms of group heuristics, and the framing of the danger as a stigmatized condition, and as such, we consider 4 different treatments arms being applied to two different groups, for a total of eight treatment conditions:\n\n1: Low Danger group, Control, Control\n2: Low Danger group, Group frame, Control\n3: Low Danger group, Control, Stigma frame\n4: Low Danger group, Group frame, Stigma frame\n5: High Danger group, Control, Control\n6: High Danger group, Group frame, Control\n7: High Danger group, Control, Stigma frame\n8: High Danger group, Group frame, Stigma frame\n\n\n\nAnd we hypothesize the following under ceteris paribus conditions:\u2003\n\u2022\tH1: The simple Group heuristic hypothesis: Group-differentiated information will cause individuals to adjust their risk perceptions in line with group membership in the absence of stigmatization.

We eventually aim to test this generality with fully experimental conditions, in which we assign \"minimal group\" identities to participants, and similarly assign various types of information about (fictitious) risks, including the stigma associated with such risks. However, given the likely challenges of credibly assigning groups and risks, and the desire to interface with pressing health and policy concerns, we propose to begin our research with experimental research on risk perception of HIV and AIDS in the American context, with White and African-American subjects as the (LD) and (HD) groups as described above. \n\nIndeed, Lieberman's (2009) research and theorizing on AIDS in the developing country context is a key motivation for this study, having found that polities characterized by strong ethnic or racial boundaries were less likely to respond aggressively to the AIDS epidemic because dynamics of inter-group competition would induce HD leaders and members to deny the risk of association with the stigmatized condition, while LD counter-parts would be more likely to fully disassociate themselves from the disease. This research aims to more rigorously test the psychological micro-foundations of such propositions with experimental control.\n\nWe are far from the first to suggest links between HIV risk perception and minority status. From the first decade of the AIDS epidemic, even the most casual observers would point out that individuals have tended to highlight that HIV and/or AIDS was someone \"else's\" problem. A common refrain in the United States was that AIDS was a problem for the \"4-H club: Haitians, Heroine users, Homosexuals, and Hemophiliacs\" (Sontag 1990; others). Scholars have already established that in the domain of HIV/AIDS, institutional mistrust is related to increased risk behavior and decreased likelihood of HIV testing, especially in ethnic minorities (Hoyt et al., 2012), and conspiracy beliefs related to HIV/AIDS are more pronounced in racial and ethnic minorities (Ross, Essian, & Torres, 2006). In particular, when information about the risks of a stigmatized condition are targeted towards a particular group in the context of strong intergroup competition or status disparities, impulses to preserve the moral or social status of the targeted group will lead members of that group to deny those risks. \n\nThe extent of race-based health disparities in the United States is well known. Particularly with respect to HIV, disease prevalence is estimated to be several times higher among African-American adults as compared with white adults. Moreover, at least in part because of its association with various non-normative behaviors, including homosexual intercourse, sexual activity with multiple partners, and intravenous drug use, AIDS has remained a \u201cstigmatized\u201d (Parker and Aggleton 2003) condition. In the face of such disparities, various organizations have sought to target African-Americans with campaigns highlighting the disproportionate AIDS burden in their community. Our research raises the possibility that this is a counter-productive policy strategy. By emphasizing that a stigmatized problem is more prevalent among a particular group, we believe that such campaigns may exacerbate threats to group pride, stimulating a tendency towards denialism. This effect might be particularly pronounced when the group in question has been more generally stigmatized or discriminated against, such that trust of institutional messages might already be more fragile.\n\nInitially, we aim to test our theory of social identity and social risk through a web-based survey experiment, in which we treat randomly assigned sub-groups of white and African-American subjects with alternate informational frames: the group-based distribution of HIV burden; and the stigmatization of the disease. These are both informational \"frames\" because amidst the vast quantity of facts that one might know or learn about a particular problem, and specifically, the problem of the danger of becoming infected with HIV, these are two perceived realities that media-brokers may or may not choose to emphasize. (As such, they are emphasis-frames, not equivalency frames, according to Chong and Druckman.) Both frames have been commonly available in popular discourse and in the media. Crucially, our research depends on our ability to, at least temporarily, affect how individuals come to understand the dangers associated with the risk of HIV infection. If they already hold firm views about these two dimensions, which cannot be even temporarily manipulated, we will not be able to identify the hypothesized treatment effects.\n\nExperimental protocol, treatment, and measurement\n\nRecruitment:\nWe employ a nationally representative sample of 1,000 Americans, comprised of 500 whites and 500 African Americans. Qualtrics, on our behalf, recruits subjects and compensates their participation through a proprietary points system an amount roughly equal to $.50.\n\nSet-up: Respondents are instructed that they will be completing a survey on \"Priorities in American Health Care.\" They are told the following:\n\nHealth care in America is an important political issue.\n\nCitizens hold many different opinions about which health problems should receive the most attention from government. In this survey, we ask you to share your views about what government should do.\n\nWe are interested in your opinions and personal views.\nInitially, respondents are shown a graphic about pancreatic cancer, which we use to verify that responses to AIDS were not conditioned on the reference/comparison disease condition (i.e. for a slight improvement in external validity). \n\nMeasurement of baseline risk perceptions: \n\nIn order to estimate treatment effects, we attempt to measure baseline perceptions of risk in such a way as to minimize respondents' awareness of our particular focus on HIV and AIDS. (We do this immediately after the start screen, before the presentation of the information on cancer, as described above.) We ask, \"How much of a concern do you think each of the following health and medical problems should be for the future development of the American health care system?\" and we offer a sliding response scale with anchors of \"Not a concern\"; \"Minor concern\"; \"Substantial concern\"; \"Important concern\"; and \"Critical concern.\" Respondents are asked to select a level of concern for each of the following: Asthma, Cancer, Poor hearing/Deafness, Diabetes, HIV and AIDS, Influenza, Obesity, Poor vision/Blindness.\" Based on this list, we can identify a baseline concern with HIV and AIDS, and also an average baseline concern for all health risks.\n\nPresentation of Health Risks:\n\nThe next screen says:\n\nWe will now provide you with information about two (2) selected health concerns. Please read this information carefully. We will then ask you a series of questions about this information, as well as how these problems are likely to affect you and what you think government should do to address them.\n\nClicking to the next screen, they are presented with a page with the heading \"CANCER,\" and the respondent reads three paragraphs about pancreatic cancer. When the respondent is done reading, the survey presents an attention check (describe below).\n\nTreatment: \nAt this point in the survey, all respondents are shown a page entitled HIV and AIDS, and all received the following first two paragraphs:\n\nThe acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which leaves individuals susceptible to opportunistic infections and tumors. \n \nAlmost every 10 minutes, an American is infected with HIV.\n\nHowever, according to the four randomly-assigned treatment arms, the page varies in the following manner:\n\nCONTROL: NO STIGMA OR RACE FRAMES\n\u2022\tHeader Graphic on left: Hand, which says \"Stop AIDS in America\"\n\u2022\tHeader Graphic on right: Red ribbon\n\u2022\tAdditional text: None\n\nRACE FRAME ONLY\n\u2022\tHeader Graphic on left: Hand, which says \"Stop AIDS in Black America\"\n\u2022\tHeader Graphic on right: Red ribbon\n\u2022\tAdditional text: Currently, African-Americans have substantially higher rates of HIV infection than white Americans or other racial or ethnic groups in the United States. African-Americans accounted for an estimated 44% of all new HIV infections among adults and adolescents in 2010, despite representing less than 15% of the US population.\n\nSTIGMA FRAME ONLY\n\u2022\tHeader Graphic on left: Hand, which says \"Stop AIDS in America\"\n\u2022\tHeader Graphic on right: Red ribbon faded with text, \"Treated as if AIDS was their FAULT and ... DENIED admission...\"\n\u2022\tAdditional text: Throughout the history of the AIDS epidemic, people with HIV or AIDS have been treated as if the disease was their fault, the result of bad behavior and bad choices. They have frequently been denied admission to schools, clubs, and foreign countries.\n\nINTERACTION: RACE AND STIGMA FRAMES\n\u2022\tHeader Graphic on left: Hand, which says \"Stop AIDS in Black America\"\n\u2022\tHeader Graphic on right: Red ribbon faded with text, \"Treated as if AIDS was their FAULT and ... DENIED admission...\"\n\u2022\tAdditional text: Throughout the history of the AIDS epidemic, people with HIV or AIDS have been treated as if the disease was their fault, the result of bad behavior and bad choices. They have frequently been denied admission to schools, clubs, and foreign countries. Currently, African-Americans have substantially higher rates of HIV infection than white Americans or other racial or ethnic groups in the United States. African-Americans accounted for an estimated 44% of all new HIV infections among adults and adolescents in 2010, despite representing less than 15% of the US population.\n\n\nMeasurement of post-treatment risk perceptions and policy priorities:\nFollowing receipt of the treatment, respondents are asked various questions about how they perceive risks of being infected with cancer and AIDS. They are asked on two successive pages, respectively entitled CANCER and AIDS,\n\n\"What is the likelihood that the following will be newly afflicted with CANCER [AIDS] in the next five years? (That is, do not include individuals who already suffer from this disease.)\"\nand respondents are asked to move a slider across a scale that reports to us a quantity from 0 to 100. Respondents do not see the number reported, but rather, they see 7 evenly spaced qualitative anchors, ranging from \"No chance,\" to \"Extremely High.\" They are required to move a slider for each of the following: \"You personally,\" \"Any member of your family,\" \"Any close friend,\" \"Anyone you know personally\" \n\nBeyond specific questions about risk, we also ask respondents their views on public policy, under the assumption that answer about policy will be a linear function of risk perceptions. First, we ask, \nIf you had a say in making up the federal budget this year, should federal spending on each kind of research be decreased, kept about the same, or increased?\n\nAnd for each of \"Cancer Research,\" and \"AIDS research,\" respondents are asked to provide a response to a 5-point Likert scale ranging from substantially decreased to substantially increased.\nThen, we attempt to cross-validate responses to this question by asking respondents to allocate the government's health budget between cancer and AIDS:\n\n\"Imagine you have the opportunity to discuss with your senator how he/she should allocate a portion of the health budget to just these two problems. Assuming that overall effectiveness of prevention methods and treatments are similar on a dollar for dollar basis, how should health spending be allocated? (Total must equal 100%)\"\n\nFinally, we attempt to capture a behavioral response to our treatment at the conclusion of the study by offering respondents the opportunity to conduct more research on their own about HIV and AIDS. The survey states, \n\nWe have no more questions for you, but we would like to provide you an opportunity to learn more about cancer and AIDS.\nBelow are some leading organizations and charities related to AIDS. If you click on any link or picture below, the link will open in a new browser tab.\nWhen you are done, please continue to the next screen by clicking the arrows below.\n\nFirst for cancer, and then for AIDS, we provide screenshots of three disease-related websites and links. For AIDS, we provide links to AIDS Info, Test Positive Aware Network, and the American Foundation for AIDS research. Our web survey will allow us to see if the respondent clicks on 0-3 of the links, and how much time the individual spent, presumably looking at the websites, just prior to concluding the survey.\n\nGroup attachment:\nWe ask, \n\nHow strongly do you feel you identify with the following groups?\n\nAnd then we provide sliders for each of the following: African-Americans, Democrats, Old People, Poor People Republicans, Rich People, Whites, Young People, and the respondent must move each slider to a point on a continuum that is anchored by text, \"Not at all,\" \"Not very closely,\" \"Somewhat closely,\" and \"Very closely.\" We capture their slider position on a 0-100 scale.\n\n\nRespondent attention / validity:\nTo try to correct for the possibility that some respondents may be primarily motivated by the monetary compensation for participation and might not carefully take the survey, we have taken a number of measures to ensure the validity of responses.\n\nFor example, we inserted timers on the survey pages so we can track how long respondents spend on each page. This allows us the possibility to eliminate respondents who spend an unusually short time on each page, suggesting they did not read the questions but merely selected answers at random. We will also look for conflicting answers to potentially identify problematic respondents, for example, if someone indicates on the battery of personality questions that they identified as \"reserved, quiet\" and later as \"extroverted, enthusiastic.\" \n\nAfter the presentation of the information on the CANCER page, we ask a question, which type of cancer was discussed on the previous page, and the respondent must pick from four choices. If the answer is not correct, the respondent is returned to the original cancer page to try again. This should have the effect of ensuring that the respondent will pay greater attention to the rest of the survey, particularly to the next page, when the framing treatments are administered.\n\nAdditional covariates:\nApart from the conditions discussed above, at this point we do not advance any further propositions about potential heterogeneous treatment effects, and we assume that with randomization, the distribution of potentially influential traits and attitudes will be largely identical across treated and control groups. Collecting data on covariates will allow us to test this assumption of balance, and possibly to conduct exploratory data analysis should our experiment yield null findings. Of course, we will report these as ex post findings. \n\n\nBased on our questions above, we create several dependent variables:\n\nFirst, we create several \u201ccalibrated\u201d risk perception scores. That is, based on our post-treatment questions about risk perception, we calculate the differences between self-reported  risk assessments for AIDS and for Cancer. We create four such variables:\n\n\u2022\tIndividual calibrated risk perception: responses to questions about \u201cyou\u201d\n\n\u2022\tFamily and friends risk perception: sum of responses to \"Any member of your family\" + \"Any close friend\"\n\n\u2022\tOverall calibrated risk perception: sum of responses to questions pertaining to all of the above + \u201cAnyone you know personally.\u201d\n\nTrust in race-based information (as is)\n\nTrust in other group-based information (as is)\n\nCalibrated budget prioritization: (as is: already forces tradeoff)\n\nCalibrated expenditure prioritization: Difference between responses to expenditure questions on AIDS and Cancer\n\nRisk prevention behavior: \n\u2022\tTime spent on AIDS websites\n\u2022\tNumber of clicks on AIDS websites\n\n\nBlocking:\nSSI maintains information about the racial identity of some, but not all, of the individuals in its panel. Moreover, in analysis of pilot data, we found that pre-treatment concern was a significant predictor of our outcome variables. Thus, we will stratify the sample in terms of the three racial categories (African-American, White, No Information) and the two categories for pre-treatment reported HIV risk (self reported scores <= 75, the median value obtained in our pilot study; and self reported scores > 75.)\n\nAnalyses:\nAfter verifying that randomization has generated balance on our covariates, we will compare difference-in-means across treatment groups by regressing each dependent variable on our eight treatment condition dummy variables. We will also replicate our analyses by conditioning on the covariates, which should provide more precise estimates of treatment effects.\n\nWe will then proceed to test our hypotheses by generating bootstrapped estimates, with 95 percent confidence intervals, of the differences between various treatment and control conditions.", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "United States", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Design was registered before field was added", "extra": []}, "timestamp": 41619.79856481482}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": 41628.0, "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "The experiment uses conjoint analysis to present respondents (N = 1,500, all U.S. adults) with various profiles of potential Supreme Court nominees.

Certain characteristics (including party, age, religion, gender, race, educational background, and previous employment) will cause respondents to be more or less likely to think that a decision reached by a Supreme Court Justice can be trusted. Specifically, a hypothetical Supreme Court Justice being female or being a racial/religious minority may be inversely related with feelings of trust, while being a co-partisan with the respondent will be positively related with feelings of trust. These effects will interact with respondent race, gender, and partisanship, as well as with respondents' attitudes on the institutional legitimacy of the Supreme Court and their own previous knowledge. These effects will be most pronounced within issue areas considered to be most political -- e.g., affirmative action, reproductive rights.\n\nH5. Respondents will support increased diversification of the courts, but only up until the point at which the courts are \"representative\" of the nation at large (e.g., the proportion of \"diverse\" judges corresponds to the actual percentage of African Americans, women, and Hispanics in the population at large). This will vary according to respondent race, gender, and partisanship, as well as with respondents' attitudes on the institutional legitimacy of the Supreme Court and their own previous knowledge.\n\nH6. More information about the current composition of the Courts will affect how important respondents think it will be to appointment a female, African American, Latino, Republican, or Democrat to the Supreme Court. Specifically, reminding respondents of the court's racial/gender composition will lead them to be more supportive of increased diversity, while reminding them of the court's partisanship composition will lead them to be more supportive of appointing someone who is more politically extreme.

The\nresults show reductions of election fraud in the polling stations where observers are deployed but evidence of displacement effects of observers onto unobserved stations.

We will also run linear regressions in which we include controls for each of our blocking variables -- polling station density, electoral competition, and observer saturation.  \n\nWe note, however, that an unbiased estimate of observers' direct effects would compare outcomes in treated polling places to those in a \"pure control\" group.  In this case, a pure control would be an unobserved polling station located in a constituency without any observers.  Although ideal for estimation purposes, we were unable to create such control constituencies. The mission of our partner, Ghana's electoral observation group, is to reduce fraud and improve the overall quality of elections.  There were therefore programmatic reasons to send observers to every constituency in the country. \n\nIn the absence of a pure control group, we will use our data to construct a set of estimated pure control outcomes.  We use these estimated pure control outcomes to adjust our causal effect estimates.  We adopt two main approaches.  In our first approach, we use outcomes in control stations in the low saturation constituencies as our estimate of the pure control outcome.  In these constituencies, fewer than 10 percent of all polling stations are observed, which ensures minimal contamination from spillover.  In our second approach, we assume a linear relationship between constituency observer saturation and outcomes in the control group.  This assumption allows us to generate an estimate of the amount of violence/intimidation at pure control stations -- that is, polling stations where observer saturation is equal to zero.  We use these two estimates of the pure control outcome to adjust our estimate of observers' direct causal effect.  \n\nTo identify generalized spillover within constituencies, we compare outcomes in control polling places at each level of observer saturation.  We will do so graphically, with differences-of-means tests, and regression models in which we interact our observer treatment indicator with indicators of constituency level observer saturation.  An increase in violence/intimidation in control polling places as  observer saturation increases is evidence that observers displace fraud to polling places within the same constituency. A decrease in  violence/intimidation in control polling places as the observer saturation increases is evidence of a deterrent effect.  \n\nTo identify spatial spillover effects, we consider spatial spillovers within Electoral Areas (EAs).  EAs are political units smaller than constituencies from which voters elect local government councilors.  Each parliamentary constituency in Ghana is divided into approximately 25 Electoral Areas, with approximately 5 polling stations within each. Polling places in the same EA are closer to one another than  they are to most other polling places outside the EA.  We can therefore use EAs to study the effect of having an observer nearby.  Our randomization process places stations into four potential experimental conditions:\n\nY_{01}-- treated stations with no other observers present in the same EA\nY_{11}-- treated stations with at least one other observer in the same EA\nY_{10}-- control stations with at least one observer present in the same EA \nY_{00}-- control stations with no observers in the same EA  \n\nTo calculate spatial spillover effects on control stations, we will compare outcomes in Y_{10} to outcomes in Y_{00}.  That is, we will examine whether outcomes in control polling stations with an observer nearby are different from those at control polling stations without any observers nearby.  To calculate spatial spillover effects on observed stations, we will compare outcomes in Y_{11} to outcomes in  Y_{01}.  That is, we will examine whether outcomes in observed polling stations with another observer nearby are different from those at observed polling places without another observer nearby.\n\nConditional on constituency saturation, each polling station has an equal probability of being treated with an observer.  However, polling stations are not distributed equally in space or across EAs. As a result, each sampled polling station does not have an equal probability of landing in each of the four experimental conditions.  This difference in treatment assignment probability implies that a simple difference-in-means comparison between the relevant experimental groups would generate biased estimates of spatial spillover effects.  We therefore estimate treatment assignment probabilities using simulation methods.  We will replicate our treatment assignment process 10,000 times and use the distribution of treatment assignments to calculate the probabilities. We will then estimate the difference in weighted means between the relevant experimental groups, where we weight units by the inverse probability that they are assigned to their actual condition.

Working in the informal sector, many street vendors have no access to basic infrastructure. This lack of access hurts street vendors, increasing their total costs of doing business, reducing their profits, and lowering their quality of life. What are the effects on street vendors of providing them with access to inexpensive solar power? We answer this question through a field experiment that randomly distributes access to a solar lighting system to street vendors in the state of Bihar, India.

A solar lighting system consists of solar panels and portable batteries. During the day, the solar panels are used to charge the batteries. At night, the vendors who are served by a given solar lighting system can use their individual battery to charge two bright LED lights. The solar lighting system is partially funded from grant money provided by researchers. However, each vendor must pay a small monthly fee to the company for supplying the company. Since some vendors in a treatment marketplace may refuse to sign up to solar lighting, the provision of a solar lighting system will be considered an ``intent to treat.'' Based on previous experience, however, we expect the vast majority of street vendors within any given marketplace to sign up to the solar lighting system. Vendors also have the option of discontinuing their participation in the study at anytime. The solar lighting intervention is implemented in collaboration with a local non-governmental organization, Nidan. The solar technology is provided by a local service company, Power Green.\n\nThe sample for the study comprises a sub-sample of 51 marketplaces in Patna, the capital city of Bihar, and the nearby town of Hajibur. Our NGO partner NIDAN has extensive experience working with these marketplaces and compiled the list of marketplaces based on its own survey conducted in 2010. We exclude marketplaces that have a reliable electricity connection or are too small for the solar lighting systems, which each serve 24 vendors at a time. These marketplaces are representative of the diversity of the vendor population living in the state of Bihar, though we are not aware of comprehensive national India data with which to compare our study population. \n\nSince some of the marketplaces are very large, we break them into natural clusters of vendors to increase the statistical power of the analysis. A natural cluster is defined as a group of geographically concentrated vendors who are in competition with each other for customers. We use natural clusters, instead of arbitrary subgroups of vendors, to avoid spillovers between treated and untreated clusters. We expect to provide solar lighting to 720 street vendors in 30 treated vendor clusters. We will survey a random sample of 500 of these vendors as our treatment group and another random sample of 500 street vendors from other clusters as a control group. Our goal is to have 40-50 control clusters, depending on feasibility. While the study unit is a firm, the randomization is clustered at the marketplace level. We use simple randomization to assign marketplaces to either treatment or control status using a random number generator.\n\nThe rollout of the panels will begin in February 2014. Power Green will assume responsibility for the on-site installation and maintenance of the panels throughout the project implementation period of 12 months. Following the conclusion of the study in January 2015, vendors in the treatment group will be allowed to continue utilizing the lighting systems if they so wish.\n\nWe conduct a total of three surveys (baseline, midline, endline) over a period of 12 months of the 1000 total vendors selected into the treatment and control groups. The baseline will be conducted in January 2014, the midline in August 2014, and the endline in January 2015. The survey questionnaire will cover eleven modules: Respondent Demographics, Asset Index, Basic Business Details, Electricity and Lighting, Technology Adoption (Skills), Digitspan, Relations with Officials and Landlords, Collective Action, Relations with Society, Crime/Safety, and Family Relations.\n\nWe then run a variety of statistical models to test the hypotheses above using instrumental variables to estimate the treatment effects.

The first is a conjoint analysis that randomly varies different characteristics of two prospective candidates, including their ethnicity, their record of public goods provision, and their history of violence.  Follow-up questions will ask which candidate respondents prefer and their level of support (ranging from 1 to 10) for each.  This experiment will test which factors (ethnicity, record of public goods provision, history of violence) are most important in Kenyans\u2019 voting decisions and whether there are interactions between these factors.  Analysis will be done using difference of means between different treatment conditions (i.e. different combinations of characteristics).  For example, I will conduct difference of means for the candidate support outcome between candidates with and without a history of violence; between candidates with different records of public goods provision; between candidates that are or are not ethnic matches with the respondent; and possibly between candidates with different interactions of characteristics (e.g. between violent and non-violent co-ethnic candidates).\n\nThe second experiment\u2014which will test hypotheses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10\u2014randomly varies a description of a potential candidate for office with respect to the candidate\u2019s ethnicity and history of violence in order to see how violence (and its interaction with ethnicity) shapes voters\u2019 perceptions of candidates for office.  In particular, respondents are randomly assigned to hear about a candidate with four possible histories of violence: a candidate with no history of violence; a candidate whose last election was characterized by ethnic violence (with no information about who was responsible); a candidate who provided youths with weapons in order to attack other tribes; and a candidate who provided youths with weapons in order to defend against attacks from other tribes.  In addition, the ethnicity of the candidate is randomly assigned, so that some candidates are respondents\u2019 co-ethnics while others are not.  All analysis of the experiments\u2019 outcomes will be done using difference of means between the different treatment conditions.\n\nIf Hypothesis 1a is true, candidates in at least one of the conditions in which they are attributed with violence (offensive or defensive) should have significantly higher mean values on questions 28-31.  If Hypothesis 1c is true, this may only be the case for co-ethnic candidates.\n\nIf Hypothesis 1b is true, candidates in at least one of the conditions in which they are attributed with violence (offensive or defensive) should have significantly higher mean values on at least some of questions 32-33 and 38-48.  If Hypothesis 1c is true, this may only be the case for co-ethnic candidates.\n\nIf Hypothesis 2a is true, candidates in the conditions in which they are attributed with violence (and perhaps the condition in which their last election was characterized by unattributed violence) should have significantly higher mean values on at least some of questions 34-37.\n\nIf Hypothesis 2b is true, candidates in the conditions in which they are attributed with violence should have significantly higher mean values on at least some of questions 24a, 25a, and 27, and answers to questions 24b and 25b should indicate some fear of retaliatory violence as a rationale.\n\nIf Hypothesis 2c is true, candidates in the conditions in which they are attributed with violence should have a significantly lower mean value on question 23a (but only for non-co-ethnics), and answers to question 24b should indicate some fear of violence as a rationale.\n\nIf Hypothesis 4 is true, respondents in any of the violence conditions (and, most strongly, the co-ethnic candidate, defensive violence condition) should have a higher mean value on trust in their own tribe (q52), feel more a member of their tribe than Kenyan (q54), agree more with Statement 1 than Statement 2 on question 55, and have a higher mean value on question 58.  They should have a lower mean value of trust in other tribes (q53).\n\nIf Hypothesis 5 is true, respondents should be more likely to remember the name of the candidate in the vignette (q49).\n\nIf Hypothesis 6 is true, candidate in the conditions in which they are attributed with violence should have a significantly higher mean value on question 26 (support of party leaders).\n\nIf Hypothesis 8a is true, co-ethnic candidates in the violence conditions should have higher mean values on questions 24a, 25a, and 27 than non-co-ethnic candidates in the violence conditions.\n\nIf Hypothesis 8b is true, non-co-ethnic candidates in each violence condition should be held more responsible for violence than co-ethnic candidates in that violence condition (q50).\n\nIf Hypothesis 9 is true, candidates in the defensive violence condition should have higher mean values on questions 24a, 25a, and 27 than candidates in the offensive violence condition, especially for co-ethnic candidates.\n\nIf Hypothesis 10 is true, co-ethnic candidates should have higher mean values on questions 24a, 25a, and 27 than non-co-ethnic candidates, especially for co-ethnic candidates.\n\nIf Hypothesis 10a is true, co-ethnic candidates should have significantly higher mean values on questions 28-31 than non-co-ethnic candidates.\n\nIf Hypothesis 10b is true, co-ethnic candidates should have significantly higher mean values on questions at least some of questions 32-33 and 38-48 than non-co-ethnic candidates.\n\nThe third and final experiment\u2014meant to test Hypothesis 7\u2014is another candidate vignette that varies whether the candidate uses combative ethnic rhetoric, as well as whether the candidate\u2019s rhetoric has been implicated in triggering violence in the past.

Again, all analysis of this experiment\u2019s outcomes will be done using difference of means.\n\nIf Hypotheses 7 is true, the mean value on questions 59a and 60a across treatment conditions should be in the following decreasing order: 1) rhetoric only 2) rhetoric+violence 3) no rhetoric or violence 4) violence only; the mean value on question 62 should be higher for the rhetoric only treatment than in the control group (no rhetoric or violence); and the respondent be more likely to agree with the statement in question 64.", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes, until June 1st 2015 or date of publication", "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "Kenya", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Registration prior to assignment of treatment", "extra": []}, "timestamp": 41698.13822916667}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": 20140310.0, "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "Responsiveness, the adherence of government to demands and signals from citizens, is considered a key, perhaps even distinguishing, characteristic of democracy (Dahl, 1971).

How do normal people in the US and around the world decide if torture is right or wrong? For that matter, how do policymakers or scholars?\n          In the past decade, torture has received dramatic policy and scholarly attention, especially in the context of counterterrorism. Research on torture has focused on perceptions of the practice (Carlsmith, 2008), support of the practice (Gronke et al. 2010), perceptions of what constitutes torture (Nordgren, McDonnell & Lowenstein, 2007; Norris, Larsen & Stastny, 2010), why the use of torture persists despite arguments against it (Arrigo & Bennett, 2007), and the efficacy of the practice (e.g. Carlsmith & Sood, 2009; Gray & Wegner, 2010; Janoff-Bulman, 2007; Santucci, 2008). While many of these studies assess stated attitudes toward torture, we do not know how media influences perceptions of this practice.  More importantly, we do not know whether people take action that is in line with their stated beliefs on torture.\n          In sum, we are left with an inadequate understanding of how people view torture based on perceived efficacy of the tactic and how stated beliefs are related to actual behaviors in support of those beliefs. The preliminary project involved a smaller number of undergraduate participants. We received a small internal grant from American University to gather information from college students. The secondary phase, for which we are now seeking funding, will use a community sample and an intelligence community sample. Most experimental studies use undergraduates as they are open and accessible. They, however, are not representative of the larger population. In our case, we are particularly interested in voting age adults, the same people that support policymakers that choose to torture or not. Additionally, we want to understand the exact kind of people that might implement these policies. Our sampling plan is to oversample DC area adults that are in or connected to the intelligence community. We will pay participants for their involvement. Because of our connections to this community, we will use snowball sampling to add additional subjects from various agencies. Currently, several of Professor Young\u2019s former students work in agencies, such as the Defense Intelligence Agency, Department of Homeland Security, and other places in the US security apparatus.\n\tIn the aftermath of September 11th, some politicians introduced the idea that torture is a necessary evil and have attempted to justify the use of torture or enhanced interrogation techniques by stating that these tactics are essential to the war on terror (e.g. Gearty, 2007). Those who support torture or enhanced interrogations tactics often justify this belief on utilitarian grounds (Carlsmith & Sood, 2009). Carlsmith (2008), however, found that while people abstractly support utilitarian laws and policies toward torture, their behaviors often contradict their stated attitudes in favor of retributive motivations.  \n\tIn fact, many scholars and activists argue that torture to gather information in interrogations is strategically counterproductive (e.g. Carlsmith & Sood, 2009; Janoff-Bulman, 2007; Santucci, 2008). Much of this discussion is anecdotal and lacks scientific rigor. Military interrogators say that torture is not effective at gathering accurate and reliable information (Janoff-Bulman, 2007). US courts have long recognized that confessions obtained during duress are neither reliable nor constitutional (Redlich, 2007). Additionally, contrary to what politicians and the media believe, torture is generally not favored by the US public (Crandall et al., 2009). In fact, Gronke et al. (2010) found the majority of Americans opposed the use of torture, as did the majority of the soldiers in Iraq, between 2001 and 2009. Given that we know torture may not be as popular as some argue, we need to know the factors that increase or decrease its popularity. Popular culture is one vehicle that might have this influence.\n\tWhen torture is shown in television and movies, there is generally a ticking-bomb scenario where the use of enhanced interrogation tactics yields the information desired by the torturer.  Janoff-Bulman (2007) states that this depiction \u201cseems to fundamentally define how we think about and react to torture interrogations\u201d (p.431). Horne (2009), among others, also argues that such depictions of torture impact public perceptions of the efficacy of torture and may alter support for these tactics.  \t\n", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "id": "20140417AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "The aim of the present study is to examine how perceived efficacy of torture in interrogations impacts proclivity to support the use of torture.

Random assignment to the three conditions is being conducted with equal probabilities. \n\nWe measure conspiracy predispositions using a scale combining responses to two questions from Oliver and Wood (2014): mean agreement on a six-point scale with \"Politics is ultimately a struggle between good and evil\" and \"Much of what happens in the world today is decided by a small and secretive group of individuals.\" (If these questions do not scale together, we may interact the treatments with the two predisposition questions separately.)\n\nThere are six dependent variables (DV1-DV6) measuring belief in the conspiracy theory that allow responses on a six point scale from \"Very unlikely\" to \"Very likely\".

This field experiment examines which situational motivations increase an individual\u2019s willingness to consume political information. It will also explore the consequences of consuming this information on interest in politics, policy attitudes and vote choice. \n\nExperimental Design:\n\nThis experiment will be carried out in partnership with a mid-sized daily newspaper in California. In May 2014, about one month prior to California\u2019s statewide primary elections, the newspaper will send emails to 100,000 members of their email list. Members of the list will receive a randomly assigned message drawn from four different types designed by the researchers. Each email version will highlight a different motivation for visiting the newspaper\u2019s primary election voter guide and ask recipients to click through to the newspaper\u2019s website.\n\nThe four email conditions are:\n\n1. Instrumental Gains: This email highlights the state government\u2019s role in funding education. We anticipate will be particularly effective at encouraging traffic among parents and have blocked on parent status in our experimental design. \n\n2. Civic duty: This email message stresses the fact that \u201cgood citizens\u201d do their part to hold government officials in check by staying informed. \n\n3. Polarization: This message stresses the partisan infighting in the state house in California, and urges people to keep up with the latest episode in the battle between the two parties. \n\n4. Placebo: This email message simply encourages people to visit the newspaper\u2019s web site to stay informed, but will not highlight any particular motivation for doing so. \n\n5. Control: A fifth group will be randomly selected to receive no email of any kind. This group will later be invited, along with the email recipients, to fill out a survey about the election.  \n\nIndividuals on the email list were assigned into experimental conditions in the following manner. First, 100,000 email addresses were randomly selected from a larger list maintained by the newspaper. Based on a request by the newspaper, 50,000 of the names sampled were drawn from individuals that currently subscribe to receive emails from the newspaper, and 50,000 were drawn from individuals who do not currently subscribe to any of the newspapers email lists. Within both the subscriber and non-subscriber samples we used marketing data to block members of the email list into three groups: those with children (whom we expect to respond especially strongly to the Instrumental Gains treatment); those without children; and those for whom parent-status is not available. This design results in six blocks of respondents. Within each of the six blocks, individuals were randomly assigned with equal probability to receive either no email, or one of the four email messages described above.\n\nFollowing the delivery of these emails, the newspaper will gather behavioral measures of the rates at which members of the five conditions (1) opened the emails and (2) clicked through to the web site, which will both serve as dependent variables in the analysis. Additional data on post-treatment web site traffic patterns among participants will also be collected.\n\nApproximately one week after the distribution of these emails, participants (including those in the control group) will be sent another email asking them to take an online survey designed by the researchers. The survey will measure demographic variables not available from the newspaper, and will also measure several additional dependent variables including political interest, intention to turnout in the primary election, vote preferences for the Gubernatorial, Congressional and State Assembly primary elections in a respondent\u2019s district, and respondent issue positions. \n\nAdvances Over Previous Research\n\nUnlike prior studies of news consumption, which recruited volunteers and largely relied on self-reported measures, our field experiment is unique in that the data are collected in an unobtrusive manner (no mention of the research being conducted appears in the treatment emails) and is being delivered by a typical source of political information, a daily newspaper. \n\nOur analysis of the effects of news consumption will also have several advantages relative to previous work. First, the effects of news consumption will be examined in an ecologically valid manner. Using respondent zip codes, candidate options on the survey will match those each individual will face in the June primary. Second, the treatment, in this case exposure to a voter guide listing candidate\u2019s issue positions, is commonly employed by media outlets and represents a common way in which voters encounter political information.", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "id": "20140503AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "Hypotheses:\n\nH1. Motivational emails will increase consumption of political information. Among those who receive an email, the motivational emails will cause individuals to score higher on the following measures than those who receive the placebo email:\n\n\ta) The rate at which emails are opened.\n\nb) The click-through rate to the newspaper\u2019s web site.\n\nH2: Voter Guide use will increase political participation, knowledge and spatial voting. Among those who receive an email, the motivational emails will increase use of the voter guide relative to the placebo email group. Consequently, we expect those receiving the emails to score higher on these outcomes:\n\t\n\ta) The willingness of individuals to participate in politics (as measured by political interest and turnout questions)\n\nb) The rate at which a set of political knowledge questions administered on the post-treatment survey are answered correctly.\n\nc) The degree to which the issue positions of participants matches the issue positions of the candidates for whom they intend to vote (i.e. spatial voting as measured in the post-treatment survey).\n\nWe will also compare the treatment groups to the groups that received no email. We expect differences in participation, knowledge and spatial voting to be sharper when comparing the no-email individuals to the email groups (H2 c-e). This is because those in the group will likely have a relatively low rate of voter guide use.  \n\nH3: Targeted Emails Will Prove More Effective At Increasing Information Consumption\n\nWe expect that parents will respond more strongly to the Instrumental Gains treatment than will non-parents. We anticipate this because the message stresses education funding, a political issue with arguably disproportionately affects/concerns parents. More specifically, (a) parents who receive the Instrumental Gains treatment should open emails and click through to the newspaper web site at higher rates than non parents in the same condition, (b) among parents, those who received the Instrumental Gains treatment should score higher on post-treatment political knowledge questions than parents in other conditions, and (c) among parents, the issue positions of those who received the Instrumental Gains treatment should conform more to the issue positions of those individuals\u2019 preferred candidates than parents who were assigned to other conditions (i.e., they should exhibit higher levels of spatial voting). \n\nH4: Knowledge Effects Should be more pronounced for State Assembly Races \n\nBecause state politics are not widely covered outside of local media sources, (while national politics are covered by a range of media outlets), we expect our encouragement emails to increase knowledge of State Assembly candidates more than knowledge of U.S. House candidates.", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "The Causes and Consequences of Consuming Political Information", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Mummolo, Peterson", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "A mid-sized daily newspaper in California", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "The newspaper will supply the researchers with measures of email opens, click-throughs and web site traffic data at the participant level prior to the administration of the post-treatment online survey. At this time it appears we will only receive traffic data for those who received an email and chose to click through, (though the newspaper has indicated they may remedy this issue prior to implementation). If that is the case, the traffic data will be censored, preventing its use in our later analysis. However, email opens and click-through rates will be available for all treated individuals, and responses on the post-treatment survey will be available for the entire sample of participants. Some individuals may choose not to take the post-treatment survey, but we anticipate that the tendency to take the survey should be roughly evenly distributed across treatment conditions. \n\nIntention To Treat Effects of Intervention\n\nTo test H1(a-c), we will compare the mean email open and click-through rates across treatment conditions. To test H2b, the political knowledge hypothesis, we will compare the rates at which respondents correctly identified the positions of candidates running in their district across all conditions. The issues on which respondents will be quizzed will match the issues listed in the newspaper\u2019s online Voting Guide. U.S. House candidates were asked their positions on the following six issues: immigration reform, the federal minimum wage, drone strikes, government surveillance, health care and climate change. State Assembly candidates were asked about: high-speed rail, irrigation, legalizing marijuana, tax rates, social services and gun restrictions. Respondents will be given a random subset of these issues and asked to identify the positions of the candidates in their district, whose name, party and occupation will be supplied, on these issues.\n\nTo test H2c, we will ask survey participants for their own positions on the same issues. Because we know the issues of the candidates in the voter guide, we will be able to assess the extent to which the issue positions of each respondent align with those of their preferred candidates (in developing the voter guide the newspaper had candidates answer the same survey questions that voters will not answer). We will then compare the alignment between own positions and candidate positions in the treatment and control groups to assess whether there is a difference. All the H3 and H4 hypotheses will be tested in a similar manner among the relevant subgroups. \n\nComplier Average Treatment Effects of Intervention:\n\nWhen comparing scores on all dependent variables across treatment groups, a simple difference in means test will be used to estimate intention to treat effects of this intervention. However, given that there will likely be two-sided noncompliance issues with using the voter guide (e.g., all individuals in the treatment group will not use the guide; some individuals in the control group may use the guide) we have also developed two ex-ante plans to estimate complier average treatment effects and make more efficient use of our data. \n\nWe will use two approaches to estimate complier average treatment effects. First, because we will have behavioral data on email clickthroughs for all individuals in the treatment groups, we can instrument clicking through to the voter guide with assignment to one of the motivational email groups relative to the placebo treatment group. This instrumented measure of voter guide use can then be used in subsequent analyses on the effect of the voter guide on political information and propensity to engage in spatial voting. This approach will only be effective if large differences in click through rates exist between the placebo group and the other motivational treatment groups. Absent these large differences we will only have a weak instrument for voter guide use. Accordingly, we have also developed a second approach to estimate these effects. \n\nSecond, we will measure voter guide use among all individuals in our follow up survey with a self-report measure. We can then instrument this self-report measure with assignment to one of the email treatment groups relative to the control group that received no email. This approach will be favorable if large differences in voter guide utilization exist between those receiving or not receiving the email. Our initial expectation is that this second approach will prove more useful in this setting as the instrument for this analysis should be stronger and, in instrumenting a self-reported measure of news consumption, we will reduce the measurement error commonly associated with these exposure self-reports.", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes, 9/1/2014", "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "United States", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Registration prior to realization of outcomes", "extra": []}, "timestamp": 41762.64375}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": 41765.0, "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "Lord, Ross, and Lepper (1979) presented the results of a laboratory demonstration that purported to show that subjects, when confronted with mixed evidence, both assimilate information in a biased manner and become polarized in their attitudes.

Due to technical difficulties in obtaining satellite imagery for several isolated parts of the city, several areas which the Tanzanian government intended to include in the program were subsequently excluded, solely due to a lack of suitable maps. This paper takes advantage of this natural experiment by collecting data on parcel and household-level outcomes at the outermost boundary of the government land registration exercise, using a regression discontinuity design to compare land which was eligible for titling to that which, to date, is still excluded from the program.\n\nAnalysis will be based on a combination of administrative data sources and a household survey designed and managed by the authors, covering households located within a 100 meter catchment area on either side of the boundary dividing settlements that were either eligible or ineligible for a property right known as a \u201cresidential license\u201d (RL).  \n\nNote: At the time of registering this pre-analysis plan, data collection has concluded.

We have had access to an incomplete sample and set of outcome variables for cleaning purposes, stripped of all information that would identify a household or parcel as treatment or control.

We enumerate 9 hypotheses, which we plan to analyze as at least two distinct papers:  one on economic outcomes (hypotheses A-E below), and a second on politcal-economic responses (hypotheses F-I).\n\nA.  Construction.  We hypothesize that RLs increase both the construction of new structures and the renovation/investment in structures on existing parcels.  In subgroup analysis, we expect the impacts of RLs to be larger for parcels that did not contain structures in 2004.  To interpret estimated impacts on the construction outcomes described in Section IV below, we will create a summary measure that aggregates the estimated individual treatment effects based on market values. Market values of each component will be estimated using the 2004 municipal building value assessment. However, for purposes of providing a summary measure of construction outcomes, we will use the approach of Katz, Kling, and LIeberman (2007) described in Section III.F.  \n\nB.  Land-market activity.  (i) We hypothesize that RLs encourage rental-market activity, as they reduce potential landlords\u2019 risk that tenants or other parties will assert ownership claims.  (ii) While reduced uncertainty about legitimate ownership is hypothesized to be conducive to sales-market activity (Besley 1994), frictions in the registration process may actually drive a wedge between the value of land to those who owned it at the time of RL receipt and prospective buyers (Jacoby and Minten 2007); consequently, the effect of RLs on land sales is a priori ambiguous.  \n\nC.  Labor-market activity and business investment.  We hypothesize that RLs will increase the supply of household labor (Field 2007) and the investment of household  funds into household enterprises (potentially due both to an increase in the supply of credit to affected households and due to the increased returns to investment on parcels where tenure security has been increased (Besley 1994; Field 2005; Besley, Buchardi, and Ghatak 2012).  We hypothesize that these should lead to greater capital stocks and higher profits.  We further hypothesis that, through these mechanisms, receipt of an RL should increase the likelihood that a household has a business enterprise of its own, and that the household has a business on the treated parcel in particular.  Th\n\nBecause these effects, measured on the population of 2014 owners, can operate either through treatment effects on owners who were resident in 2004 or through the transfer of ownership to households with greater labor supply and investment, we will estimate heterogeneous effects of the RL by subgroups defined by \u2018fixed\u2019 ownership.  \n\nD.  Credit access.  We hypothesize that RLs should increase both the demand for, and supply of, credit, though the literature presents mixed results on the credit-supply response (Field and Torero 2008; Besley et al. 2012). \n\nE.  Tenure security and disputes.  We hypothesize that receipt of a RL should  (i) reduce the owner\u2019s perceived risk of expropriation by the government; and (ii) reduce the incidence of disputes among both owners and renters.\n\nF.  Market attitudes, including individualism and trust.  Galiani and Schargrodsky (2007) find evidence that the issuance of titles has positive effects on four dimensions of what they term \u2018market-oriented\u2019 beliefs:  individualism, the importance of money to happiness, the extent to which effort is rewarded, and whether others can be trusted.  We test the hypothesis that there are positive effects on the same dimensions.  Since surveys often ask many such questions, and since the line between market-oriented and other aspects of beliefs and attitudes is a blurry one, we believe this is an area in which pre-commitment to a plan for this analysis, which mirrors the G&S measures, adds rigor to this rare replication opportunity.\n\nG.  Attitudes toward the state.  A large literature in political science considers the impact of taxation on citizens\u2019 demand for, and ability to exercise, accountable governance (Bates and Lien 1985; North and Weingast 1989; TIlly 1991; Ross 2004).  James Scott (1999) has argued that systems of property rights are essentially vehicles for states to bring their citizens into the formal system of taxation, and indeed, residents of Dar es Salaam were required to pay back taxes in order to obtain Residential Licenses.  We hypothesize that this will induce a shift in residents\u2019 perceptions of their relationship with the state, toward more active citizenship. We therefore expect positive effects on four measures:  (i) greater support for questioning leaders; (ii) greater support for the view that government should be accountable to citizens; (iii) greater opposition to clientelistic policies; and (iv) greater support for elections.\n\nH.   Satisfaction with public services.  Our view , based on anecdotes at a city-wide level, is that the increase in tax revenue was not met with a commensurate improvement in the quality of government services. Taking subjective satisfaction with public services to be judged relative to these expectations, we hypothesize that satisfaction with government services will have declined, across all  levels of government.\n\nI.  Political engagement.  For reasons outlined above, we expect receipt of RLs to have positive effects on political engagement. We test this hypothesis using five specific measures: (i) engagement with the news media; (ii) informal discussions of politics; (iii) social group participation; (iv) active citizenship; and (v) voting.", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "The Impact of Property Rights Formalization in Urban Tanzania: Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Design", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Collin, Sandefur, Zeitlin", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Intervention was implemented by the Minstry of Lands and Temeke Municipality.", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "The hypotheses will be tested using unique, parcel-level data collected on the universe of parcels within a 100 meter bandwidth on either side of an administrative boundary that defined whether parcels were eligible for title in 2004.  \n\n The empirical specification employed in the analysis is a regression discontinuity design. To make use of quasi-experimental assignment of sub-wards (mitaa) to treatment, while allowing for the possibility that potential outcomes vary smoothly across space, we treat distance to the 2004 mitaa border as a running variable.  This is a fuzzy regression discontinuity design in the sense that there is one-sided noncompliance:  while no parcels on the \u2018control\u2019 side of the boundary could have been treated, not all parcels on the \u2018treatment\u2019 side of the parcel opted to apply for Residential Licenses.  We commit to present results from two types of RD estimators, as in Abdulkadiroglu, Angrist, and Pathak (2014).   \n\n(1)  Our non-parametric specification will implement a locally linear regression, with bandwidth choice following the data-driven procedure of Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2012, henceforth IK).

Very little is also known about how citizens form their priors about what outcome they expect to occur. The primary motivation of this study is explore whether exposure to political polling information changes people\u2019s views both in the short term before an election and in the longer term after the election. In the study, I collect a reliable sample-based estimate of candidate support prior to an election and then use this information as a treatment in a lab environment. The study is designed to help answer the question about what impact polling information has in the context of a Georgian election and how incentivization changes the quality of people\u2019s guesses about election outcomes.  A secondary motivation also informs the study. Given recent scandals about polling in Georgia, the study attempts to estimate the true level of trust in political opinion polls in Georgia using a double list experiment.\n\nResearch Design: Part 1 of the study design involves administering a sample survey to a representative sample of the population in a municipality bordering the city of Tbilisi, Georgia (Kaspi). 800 interviews will be attempted with a target response of 700. This survey is composed of approximately 30 questions as well as 2 randomization protocols. In the first randomization protocol, in the treatment group, respondents will be told that they will receive a monetary reward based on their predictions about the outcome of an election and a game will be played in order to elicit both respondent\u2019s point estimates and the variation around such point estimates about the election outcome. Before playing this game, they will have four practice rounds where the enumerator flips a coin four times and respondents are asked to predict the outcome of this coin flip. After the election, they will then receive a monetary reward based on their guesses. In the control group, respondents will be asked to make their guesses without incentivization. In a second randomization within the same survey, a double list experiment will be carried out to, where the sensitive item is public opinion polls and the goal is to understand the true level of trust in public opinion polls.\n\nBecause the list experiment follows the incentivized experiment, there may be an interaction between the first and the second experiment. I divide those are are incentivized in the first randomization protocol into three groups for the double list experiment. Therefore, given the sample size, I only give the control treatment of asking each item independently to those who are not incentivized. The three types of lists are randomized for incentivized participant in the first experiment. All other elements of the survey are administered to all respondents. The dependent variables for the survey are the game predictions and the outcome of the list experiment.\n\nPart 2 will take place in Kaspi. The research protocol involves 3 phases. In phase 1, subjects will be recruited only from the town of Kaspi and several demographic variables will be collected to use block assignment to treatment. Subjects (approximately 225) will be then assigned to either one of two treatment groups or a control group. They will be assigned to treatment using multivariate continuous blocking.  In phase 2, subjects will be asked to elicit their priors about election related outcomes as well as several demographic questions and behavioral questions about legitimacy and election related outcomes. Those that are assigned to treatment will receive radio stories constructed from local media AND a radio story constructed from aggregate survey data collected in the survey carried out in Part 1.  There are two different treatment groups. One group is told in the story that an American academic carried out the survey and a second is told that a local research organization carried out the survey. The control group will only receive radio stories from the local media. After the news stories, the same questions asked at the beginning of phase 2 will be repeated. In phase III, there will be a follow up survey with participants in the laboratory experiment to elicit their posteriors after the election occurred. The dependent variables are measures of election legitimacy, willingness to protest, voting behavior, and differences in posterior and prior beliefs before and after being assigned to randomization group -- and after the election.

Turnout is our first dependent variable looking at the treatments' effect on voting online. In addition, we hypothesize that the different GOTV messages may also affect the election outcome. This could be either due to the messages mobilizing different sections of the electorate or by the message directly priming voters to choose differently. We remain agnostic between these \u2018mechanisms\u2019 and focus on the effect that these messages can have on the outcome of the vote on: 1) budget amounts (total spending voted for); and 2) specific sectoral preferences. \n\nFurthermore, since we do not measure vote choice for non-voters, we will only be able to make this comparison for voters who turnout online. This also means we cannot distinguish between composition mechanisms (different voters turning out) and preference mechanisms (the treatments directly affect vote choice), although we find the composition mechanism more likely. Nevertheless we believe the descriptive effect of different GOTV approaches on vote choice is an important topic in itself. \n\nTurnout\nOur treatments include informational, intrinsic, and extrinsic messages (more below). Our first set of hypotheses refer to these messages' effect on turnout. We stipulate that,\n\n\tH1: GOTV messaging increases turnout in contacted individuals.\n\nAs well as the overall effect of GOTV email and SMS messages on turnout, we look at the differential impact of informational, intrinsic and extrinsic messages. We will test the six different two-way comparisons of extrinsic, intrinsic and informational messages to look at which (if any) are significantly more effective than the others. Although we hypothesize that all the messages will have a positive turnout effect (and therefore will use one-tailed tests), we will test all comparisons between the messages, as we do not believe there is currently a deep enough literature to justify a strong prior belief about the relative effectiveness of the different messages. Hence the six within treatment comparisons will use two-tailed tests. \n\nBudget totals\nFor the budget totals we will compare the mean total budget cost (rescaled as described below) of the options that voters in the different treatment groups and controls pick. We will make the comparison of the control versus the pooled treatment groups and also compare the means of the treatment groups separately (12 comparisons). Since little is known about the effect that different GOTV messages have on vote choice an effect in either direction (or none) is plausible. Each of these comparisons will be calculated with a two-tailed test. \n\nSectoral preferences\nFinally, we consider the effect of the various treatments on the propensity to vote for different types of priorities. The categories will be defined based on the proportion in the data (see outcome section below) but assuming that the top categories are the same as in 2013 and 2012 we would have the categories of health, public safety and civil defense, rural development and other. Once again, we are open to the possibility that intrinsic and extrinsic messages could promote or reduce the vote share of any of these. The proportion of people who choose each proposal category may differ depending on whether they received no message, an informational message, an intrinsic encouragement or an extrinsic encouragement. The sectoral preference tests will therefore involve 48 comparisons. Each of these comparisons will be calculated with a two-tailed test.", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Public Policy Vote Field Experiment: A GOTV During the Participatory Budgeting Vote in Rio Grande do Sul, June 2014", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Sjoberg, Mellon, Peixoto", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Researchers", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "The unit of analysis is individual voters (as identified by voter registration number).

Research on torture has focused on perceptions of the practice, support for the practice, perceptions of what constitutes torture, why the use of torture persists despite arguments against it, and the efficacy of the practice. While many of these studies assess stated attitudes toward torture, scholars have not yet adequately addressed how framing impacts perceptions on torture. Additionally, research to date has focused only on stated attitudes about torture. Yet, as we know from other domains, there may be a disparity between what people say and how they act, especially on a contentious issue such as torture. We are left with an inadequate understanding of how framing impacts views on torture, and how stated beliefs are related to actual behaviors in support of those beliefs. The present study will fill this gap in the literature by examining how the interrogator-suspect dyad, proximity to the event, and type of behavior used impact perceptions of torture. This study will also examine how framing impacts behavior in support of stated attitudes to more fully elucidate the relationship between beliefs and actions about torture. The proposed project will involve a pilot study and will be adjusted and scaled up based on funding.\n\nSince the revelation of the so-called torture memos, academics, policymakers, and observers have argued over how to define and measure it. Some politicians and members of government in the United States have attempted to redefine torture, argued that actions in which military and intelligence officers have engaged do not meet the definition of torture, or that laws against torture do not apply to detention centers overseas. Among civilians, the definition of torture differs between individuals, and an individual\u2019s conceptualization of torture is also fuzzy (Norris, Larsen & Stastny, 2010). What is and is not perceived to be torture varies both between and within individuals, depending on how the practice is framed. Research has shown that how one perceives torture can vary based on a number of factors, including whether or not the perpetrator or the suspect is a member of the observer\u2019s in-group (Miron, Branscombe & Biernat, 2010; Norris et al., 2010; Tarrant, Branscombe, Warner & Weston, 2012) and proximity to the act (Gray & Wegner, 2010).  \n\nSherif et al. (1961) found that a strong notion of in-group and out-group identity can lead to increased aggression. Recent experiments have applied this finding to test the impact of in-group and out-group identity on perceptions of torture. Participants in experiments are more likely to define an act as torture when it is perpetrated against a member of their in-group as opposed to an out-group member (Norris et al., 2010), are more likely to justify torture and have less empathy for the suspect with the perpetrator is a member of the participant\u2019s in-group (Tarrant et al., 2012), and require a higher level of injustice and more information to say that a practice perpetrated by a member of their group was racist (Miron et al., 2010). Research has also shown that threats from an out-group, as is the case since 9/11, can generate more support for strict policies (e.g. Moghaddam, 2007) and has led to more prejudice against Arab Americans (see Oswald, 2006 and Persson, Musher & Dara, 2006)\n\nGray and Wegner (2010) examined differences in perceptions of guilt and pain in an experiment on torture using distant and close conditions. While their aims were different than those of this study, we too utilize distant and close conditions to understand how spatial proximity to the torturous event impacts perceptions of torture as a function of the dyad involved in the act and in-group bias. Additionally, research has shown disparity between individuals\u2019 stated attitudes toward torture and their actual beliefs about the practice. For example, Carlsmith (2008) found that while people abstractly support utilitarian laws and policies toward torture, their behaviors often contradict their stated attitudes in favor of retributive motivations. Furthermore, Carlsmith and Sood (2009) found disparity between stated reasons and actual reasons for support torture.  We are also interested in differences between perceptions of psychological versus physical torture.\n\nThe aim of the present study is to broaden our understanding of torture perceptions by examining how views are impacted by both the interrogator-suspect dyad, spatial proximity to the event, and type of torture method used. The study will also bridge another gap in the literature by including a behavioral measure in addition to attitudinal measures. This study uses a 4 (race in the interrogator-suspect dyad) x 2 (domestic v v. transnational) x 3 (psychological torture v. physical torture v. no torture) a between-subjects design aimed at understanding how in-group bias and spatial proximity to torture impact perceptions of torture and willingness to behave in a manner that is consistent with stated beliefs. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of 24 conditions.  \n\nOur project will be listed on Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk website for participants to voluntarily decide to participate.  Each participant will first read and accept the consent form before being directly to our questionnaire housed on SurveyMonkey, which allows for random assignment to one of the 24 conditions.  By listing the 24 conditions under one name on MTurk, this prevents a person from being able to participate twice.  Once on SurveyMonkey, each participant will be randomly assigned to a condition.  Participants will first fill out a background demographic questionnaire, followed but a questionnaire about attitudes and opinions about various interrogation tactics.  Participants will then read a vignette about a HYPOETHICAL interrogation scenario.  We will vary the dyad of the interrogator and suspect using Caucasian and Middle Eastern names to create four conditions (Caucasian interrogator-Caucasian suspect, Caucasian interrogator-Middle Eastern suspect, Middle Eastern interrogator-Caucasian suspect, Middle Eastern interrogator-Middle Eastern suspect).  We will also vary whether the interrogation described in the vignette takes place in the United States or in Afghanistan to create two conditions.  Lastly, we will vary whether the hypothetical interrogation tactics described are considered psychological torture, physical torture, or no torture (control) to create three conditions.  All together, there are 24 conditions in this study.  After reading the vignette describing a hypothetical, participants will answer a series of questions about the scenario and fill out another questionnaire about their attitudes and opinions about various interrogations tactics.  Lastly, participants will be told that they have the option to sign a petition to the White House that is either a) in support of the tactics in the vignette, b) in opposition to the tactics in the vignette, or c) they can skip this option without penalty.  MTurk's policies do not allow us to actually collect identifying information from participants, so we will proxy this by asking participants to click one of the aforementioned options that will take them either to the appropriate survey or to the end of the study.  Regardless of which option someone clicks, the next screen will inform them that there is not actually a petition and will also include the debriefing information.", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "id": "20140611AB", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "H1: \tParticipants will be more likely to describe the scenario as torture when the suspect is Caucasian than when the suspect is of Middle Eastern descent.\nH2:  Participants will be more likely to describe the scenario as torture when the perpetrator is of Middle Eastern descent than when the perpetrator is Caucasian.\nH3:  Participants in the Middle Eastern interrogator-Caucasian suspect condition will have the most disparity between stated beliefs about the use of torture and behavior supporting their stated beliefs.

The current body of research lacks independent and scientific study of NGO behavior. Though there are some examples, these outliers are rare and difficult to generalize (see Reinikka and Svensson 2001). As NGOs become more influential in development, a more scientific understanding of their behavior becomes critical (Aldashev and Verdier 2010; Doh and Teegen 2002). In order to increase the body of scientific knowledge concerning NGO behavior, we perform a randomized field experiment designed to measure the extent of NGO opportunism.\n\nVariation in NGO type and function increases the difficulty of generalizing about NGO behavior (hence the need for a randomized controlled experiment). For some time, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have played an important role in public good provision and development initiatives. Because most NGOs claim non-profit status, political neutrality, liberal ideology, and a normative agenda, NGOs are considered by many to be the ideal mechanism for success in these important assignments. In some cases, NGOs may be the only mechanism. Yet the term \u201cNGO\u201d can apply to wide range of organizations (Spar and Dail 2002). Indeed, the variation can be so great (and multi-dimensional) that two NGOs may have nothing in common besides their non-profit, non-government status. NGOs may be international or community-based, well-funded or non-funded, infrastructure-oriented or advocacy-oriented. In short, it is a mistake to treat NGOs as a black box.\n\nFurthermore, the nature of typical NGO projects does not lend itself easily to measurement and accountability. Traditional mechanisms of accountability employed in the for-profit sector are ineffective in the NGO-sector. NGOs may not be concerned with increasing revenue or maximizing profits. There are few established professional codes of conduct to compare across organizations. The outcome of NGO projects and initiatives are often non-quantifiable (Fowler 1996). As mentioned, this leads many to speculate about the effects of increased NGO population and competition for funding. Many are hopeful, assuming NGOs will cooperate, coordinate and be unaffected in pursuit of their organizational missions (Matthews 1997; Simmons 1998; Price 1998). Others are less optimistic, claiming that NGOs will behave opportunistically in order to survive in an uncertain environment (Cooley and Ron 2002; Aldashev and Verdier 2010). Many point to growing principal-agent problems between donors, NGOs, and constituents (Brown and Moore 2001; Doh and Teegen 2002). It is important to note that none of this necessarily suggests that NGOs are becoming inherently corrupt and dishonest, or that their altruistic missions have changed. It does suggest that as competition for donor funds increases and as NGOs become more populous, NGOs may need to behave selfishly or opportunistically in some domains for their own preservation. At times, self-interested NGO priorities may not agree with those of their donors or their constituents (Cooley and Ron 2002).\n\nThe current study seeks to assess whether NGOs behave opportunistically in the context of establishing a partnership with a research institution for future projects and funding. We randomly assign five conditions across a large sample of NGOs (n > 50,000) in India. In each condition, NGOs are informed (via email) about the possibility of a future partnership with the Political Economy and Development Lab (PEDL). At the end of the email, each NGO is asked to respond to a survey in which the NGO estimates reimbursement cost for the use of their staff members in the future partnership. Each treatment condition receives a different level of additional information about PEDL in the text of the survey. We analyze the effect of this additional information on the estimated reimbursement cost. The extent to which the estimated reimbursement cost varies relative to the control condition is our measure of opportunistic behavior. This is the third round of experiments on the topic: the first was conducted with roughly 800 NGOs in Uganda, the second with 13,000 international NGOs worldwide, and this third experiment will study the 52,000 Indian NGOs.", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "id": "20140627AB", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "This experiment yields itself to four specific hypotheses. (I) When an audit is promised to evaluate an eventual partnership between PEDL and an NGO, estimated reimbursement costs will increase as NGOs are more careful to account for even minor expenses related to the project. (II) Implied project competition will increase reimbursement cost as NGOs may not respond to market competition incentives, but instead may be motivated to signal credibility through higher costs. (III) Information revealing PEDL\u2019s familiarity with NGO partnerships\u2014 suggesting minimal information asymmetry\u2014should decrease estimated reimbursement cost. (IV) NGOs\u2019 estimated reimbursement costs will increase when given information suggesting wealthy donors and abundant resources.\n\nTreatment 1, the Audit Condition, receives the following additional language:\n\n\u201cPlease be aware that all PEDL projects are subject to thorough audits, so any expenses in future partnerships will be carefully scrutinized.\u201d\n\nThis additional information should prompt NGOs to be more careful when they respond with their reimbursement cost per staff member per day. A prima facie expectation might be that NGOs will lower their estimates in wariness of being revealed to have submitted inflated bids. Alternatively, as NGOs are more careful in the calculation of their reimbursement cost, we might also expect that they will factor more expenses into their estimates. Thus, despite the logic behind the avoidance of being caught inflating bids, we expect estimates to increase in response to the Audit Condition. Additionally, because of the added accountability, we expect this treatment will also decrease response rates. Some NGOs may be discouraged from responding because they are unaccustomed to rigorous audits or lack the organization to handle them.\n\nTreatment 2, the Competition Condition, is designed to signal to the recipient NGOs that PEDL is considering the reimbursement cost estimates of multiple NGOs. The treatment implies that PEDL is most likely to partner with the NGO that provides the most competitive estimate. The additional language added to this e-mail is found here:\n\n\u201cPlease be aware that we have sent the same inquiry to many organizations, so there will likely be competition for future partnerships.\u201d\n\nMicroeconomic theory suggests that competition should induce lower prices. Therefore, NGOs should submit lower bids in this condition. However, while NGOs have strong incentives to contract with PEDL for future partnerships, we suspect that NGOs operate with the understanding that credibility may be more important than cost in the non-profit sector. Furthermore, NGOs may operate with the understanding that higher reimbursement cost is a signal of credibility and competence. Based on these assumptions and against microeconomic expectations, we expect that NGOs will increase their reimbursement estimates in response to the Competition Condition.\n\nTreatment 3, the Prior Knowledge Condition, is designed to suggest minimal information asymmetry between the donor/partner and the local NGO. Often miscommunication and confusion results from information asymmetry, which leads to increased financial cost and inefficiency in development work. Implying that PEDL has partnered with NGOs before and is familiar with typical reimbursement costs should reduce confusion and push NGOs to be more careful calculating their estimates. The additional language for this treatment is as follows:\n\n\u201cPlease be aware that we have worked with many NGOs around the world, so we are familiar with average personnel costs.\u201c\n\nWe expect this additional information will prompt NGOs to lower their reimbursement estimates compared to the control group.\n\nLastly, Treatment 4, the Big Money Condition, contains the following additional language:\n\n\u201cPlease be aware that past projects have been supported by more than $3 million in grants and contracts from donors including the Gates Foundation, the Hewlett Foundation, the World Bank, and the African Development Bank, so PEDL typically brings significant resources to partnerships.\u201d\n\nThis treatment suggests that PEDL is well funded and endowed with abundant resources. This provides an incentive for NGOs to inflate their reimbursement estimates because there are no institutional constraints or traditional ranges for reimbursement costs in development work. We expect that NGOs will behave opportunistically by increasing their reimbursement estimates in response to this treatment. We also suspect that response rates will increase due to this treatment. Because the information suggests there is significant money and resources available, we expect NGOs will be more confident in their chances of establishing a partnership.", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Are NGOs Opportunistic?

This phenomenon, referred to as the \u201cresource curse,\u201d seems to especially undermine good governance, and good governance is often essential to economic development. Because governments engaged in natural resource exploitation receive large amounts of revenue from sources unattached to the democratic process, mechanisms for accountability weaken and investment in human capital decreases (Bulte et al. 2005; Dunning 2005). Such governments often become more autocratic and more prone to corruption and clientelism as government officials seek political and personal gain (Robinson et al. 2006; Collier and Hoeffler 2005).\n\nCritics charge that both natural resource rents and foreign aid are \u201cwindfall revenues\u201d or \u201csovereign rents\u201d that can enable corruption and undermine governance. Indeed, some studies suggest foreign aid dependence acts much like the resource curse in demotivating citizens and enabling bad governance (Smith 2008; Djankov et al. 2008; Br\u00e4utigam and Knack 2004). Moreover, because aid allocations from donors fluctuate, governments receiving large amounts of aid can experience economic and political instability, and when aid is suddenly reduced the likelihood of conflict increases (Nielsen et al. 2011). Corruption and clientelism are also associated with foreign aid, as government officials have been known to use foreign funds for political and personal gain (Knack 2001; Svensson 2000). These and other problems with the receipt of foreign aid appear to parallel the problems of over-reliance on resource exploitation.\n\nOther studies have questioned the inevitability of the resource curse and claimed that the effects of resources on governance are contingent on other factors (Haber and Menaldo 2011; Jensen and Wantchekon 2004; Dunning 2005). Others have argued that aid has less damaging effects than natural resource revenues because foreign donors can and often do condition aid on government performance and require greater accountability in spending (Jensen and Wantchekon 2004; Collier, 2006; Dunning 2008; Bermeo 2013).  However, a distinction in the resource curse literature regarding the \u201cappropriability\u201d of rents from different natural resources suggests that the adverse effects of aid on governance may be more severe (Boschini, Pettersson and Roine, 2007; Isham et al., 2005).  Specifically, aid revenues are relatively \u201cappropriable,\u201d as most aid goes directly from donors to central governments.\n\nYet, the majority of existing research on the resource curse utilizes cross-national, observational data, limiting the ability to make causal claims or address micro-level mechanisms. Moreover, despite the fact that much of the resource-curse literature relies on micro-foundational arguments about individual-level responses to new revenues, the micro-foundations of the resource curse have been undertheorized. It is not clear, for example, why less taxation would diminish voters\u2019 political will to hold politicians accountable and thus why windfall revenues, originating from either aid or natural resources, would yield higher rates of rent-seeking than tax-based revenues (see Paler 2013). Further investigation of the resource curse with observational data is unlikely to resolve outstanding micro-foundational questions. This is partly because correctly estimating the effects of windfall revenues is difficult: in countries that have already received oil revenues, citizen\u2019s expectations and willingness to sanction will be endogenous to changes in spending patterns or legislative behavior that have occurred as a result of those revenues.\n\nReferences\n\nAnderson, Michael L. 2008. \u201cMultiple inference and gender differences in the effects of early intervention: A reevaluation of the Abecedarian, Perry Preschool, and Early Training Projects.\u201d Journal of the American Statistical Association 103, 484: 1481-95.\n\nBermeo, Sarah Blodgett. 2013. \u201cAid is Not Oil: Donor Preferences, Heterogeneous Aid, and the Aid-Democratization Relationship.\u201d Article manuscript.\n\nBoschini, Anne D., Pettersson, Jan, Roine, Jesper, 2007.

Assessing changes in citizen action relative to this baseline will enable more credible and precise causal estimates of the windfall revenues\u2019 effects on voters\u2019 evaluations of government performance and their willingness to sanction elected officials. Unsurprisingly, there are relatively few cases where these conditions are satisfied and where large-scale field experimentation is possible. Fortunately, with high levels of foreign assistance and the recent and highly-publicized discovery of sizeable oil fields (see e.g. Anderson and Browne 2011), Uganda is an ideal location for this study. \n\nWe thus propose to identify the micro-level effects of different sources of new government revenues on citizens\u2019 and elites\u2019 willingness to take costly action to promote better governance. The study will employ a survey experiment with behavioral outcomes in Uganda on a nationally representative sample of Ugandan citizens as well a convenience sample of Members of Parliament. Respondents will be randomized into one of four treatment conditions testing the between-subjects effects on behavior of three potential sources of revenue: oil, taxes, aid projects implemented by government and aid projects implemented by non-governmental organizations (NGOs). In each condition, respondents will hear a short vignette about government or NGO spending. The vignette will include information on the amount and source of additional revenue that will be available to the Ugandan government or NGOs in the near future. \n\nExisting literature suggests three broad mechanisms through which windfall revenues affect government behavior: the spending effect, the accountability effect, and the repression effect. For each of these effects, we have multiple outcome measures that will serve as dependent variables in our analysis. For both elite and general public respondents, we will estimate the relative average treatment effect by comparing one treatment group with another. This will yield six comparisons: aid/government with oil, aid/government with taxes, aid/NGOs with oil, aid/NGOs with taxes, aid/government with aid/NGOs, and taxes with oil. \n\nBoth citizens and MPs will be asked a battery of questions, including, most importantly, their preferences over how the resources should be spent; their beliefs about how the resources are likely to be spent; how accountable and transparent they believe spending from the new revenue source will be; whether it will affect political stability and competition; and their prior knowledge of spending patterns. Citizens will then be invited to sign a petition to their member of parliament calling for a new government agency in charge of tracking how the money will be spent. Enumerators will also request that citizens send a text message to be relayed to their member of parliament calling for the agency. Finally, enumerators will invite citizens to donate part or all of their compensation for participating in the study to an NGO promoting transparency and good governance (Action Aid, Transparency International, or a different NGO of their choosing). MP subjects will be invited to sign a statement calling for a sovereign wealth fund. The inclusion of both the general public and elite respondents will provide unique insights into potential differences in how the two sets of actors view different revenue sources. \n\nThis study will be supplemented after three years by a second round that will replicate the experiment with many of the same respondents, taking identical measurements along a range of political and economic indicators. It will provide, for the first time, an ability to estimate, at the micro-level, the effect of oil spending along several dimensions, including on income, access to local public goods, government performance, political competition, and political accountability. Such data is especially valuable given the often poor quality of government spending data and the potential for such figures to be inaccurate or misleading.\n\nBroadly speaking, existing research thus suggests three broad classes of effects that are applicable at the micro-level, with each having empirical implications that can be tested with this study. Each class of effects applies to both aid and oil, with the relevant comparison group being the tax treatment. \n\nFirst, if resource revenues allow elected officials to avoid financing social spending with broad-based taxation, citizens may have fewer vested interests in holding elected officials accountable for performance and spending patterns. This should manifest itself in two ways: in the first round of data collection, those who expect to benefit from oil revenues should feel less inclined to take costly action to monitor or sanction government behavior compared to citizens in regions without oil. In the panel data, we should similarly observe that those who have benefited objectively (measured as realized per-capita oil revenue) are less inclined to take action. These expectations are consistent with recent work by Martin (2013), which suggests that taxation may also work to induce accountability by activating a fairness norm among voters. Where voters are taxed more, Martin demonstrates, they also make more demands on elected leaders. \n\nThe second prediction flows from the so-called repression effect. A one-party state with regular elections, Uganda is widely regarded as an anocracy, one in which the ruling party, the National Resistance Movement (NRM), uses its financial and coercive advantage to intimidate opponents and purchase electoral support through large-scale electoral clientelism (see e.g. Conroy-Krutz and Logan 2012). Ross (2001) suggests that resource rents in such states may be used to repress opponents, with the state investing in new repression technologies or simply deploying existing technologies more frequently. While we cannot test this directly in the first round of data collection, we can test whether citizens believe that resources will be used in this way. In the second round of data collection, we will be able to identify this effect more directly by comparing citizen exposure to intimidation (particularly near elections) in locales with high per capita oil revenues to those in low-spending constituencies.\n\nThe final effect is that driven by the additional spending that is made possible by windfall revenues. The expectation is that, as governments receive windfall revenues, they are able to finance broad-based social welfare improvements, either through local public goods provision or conditional cash transfers. Simply put, the repression effect occurs when additional revenues are used by the incumbent to wield a stick to intimidate citizens and opposition groups; the spending effect is the carrot. This spending, when in line with citizen preferences, has the effect of increasing support for incumbent politicians and/or the ruling coalition. This effect will not be observable in the first wave, since there is no realized spending. However, we will be able to precisely estimate this effect (if it exists) after the conclusion of the second round. \n\nThe spending effect is thought to purchase the population\u2019s acquiescence to authoritarian governance, and is thus one of the most important mechanisms in explaining the relationship between windfall revenues and changes in indexes of democracy such as Polity or Freedom House scores. The ability to observe this effect directly is a key strength of the project and, to the best of our knowledge, would be the first direct test of the spending effect at the micro-level. A broad outline of the effects we expect to see are presented in Table 1 below. We have listed the treatment conditions in order of where citizens should express the greatest concerns on the dimensions of accountability, repression, and spending.\n\nA survey experiment with behavioral outcomes provides advantages in assessing these hypotheses for several reasons. First, and most importantly, micro-level behavior is a function of self-interest and prior beliefs, and uncovering the effects noted above requires accurate estimates of both. Second, a traditional survey, where respondent are asked about their beliefs and expectations for multiple types of new revenue\u2014e.g. aid/gov\u2019t, aid/NGOs, taxes, and oil\u2014is likely to induce priming effects and contamination. By randomizing each of the respondents into one of four experimental conditions, we eliminate the possibility that answers to questions about a given revenue source are influenced by preceding questions about different sources. \n\n\u2003\nTable 1: Expectations of Citizen Responses Across Several Outcomes\n\nEffect Type\tHierarchy Among Revenue Sources\nAccountability \tOil > Aid/Gov\u2019t > Tax  > Aid/NGOs\nRepression\tOil > Aid/Gov\u2019t > Tax > Aid/NGOs\nSpending\tOil > Aid/Gov\u2019t > Tax > Aid/NGOs", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "The Resource Curse, Oil Rents and Aid Dependence in Uganda: A Field Experiment", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "De la Cuesta, Knack, Milner, Nielson", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Researchers", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "For this experiment, we will draw a nationally representative sample of Ugandan citizens (n = 2,500) and a convenience sample of members of parliament and former candidates for parliament (n = 300). We will oversample in districts that are the sites of oil exploration and in districts with high and low concentrations of foreign aid based on AidData\u2019s georeferenced dataset of foreign aid. In interviews with a representative sample of Ugandan citizens and with a convenience sample of MPs, we will present a randomly assigned statement about the source of significant public funds and then ask subjects a series of questions about what they think the effects of the funds will be and where they think these funds should be spent. \n\nBoth the citizen and MP surveys first ask questions covering a wide array of standard demographic characteristics. These include ethnicity, age, gender, education, employment, income, quality of life, access to public services, government effectiveness, media consumption, political knowledge, political interest, political activity, political trust, party affiliation, perceptions of corruption, and perceptions of clientelism. Some of the questions in the MP survey are dropped or modified appropriately in consideration of the different baseline levels of knowledge, political background, and sensitivity. For the MP survey, a battery of questions is added inquiring after MPs\u2019 control of government funds and aid money.\n\nAfter the battery of demographic questions, we will randomly assign subjects to receive a statement about billions of dollars in revenue from oil receipts, aid flows through government, aid flows through NGOs, or domestic taxes. Randomization of treatment assignment allows us to uncover systematic differences in subject responses across conditions. We will test the effects of the information conditions both on subjects\u2019 attitudes and on their willingness to take action imposing personal costs by signing a statement calling for an independent resource tracking agency; sending an SMS message to their MP; and donation of survey remuneration to watchdog NGOs. Outcomes for MPs will include signing a statement supporting the creation of a sovereign wealth fund.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS\n\nBoth citizen and MP subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment and control conditions in which they are provided with information framing a set of survey questions that deepen and reinforce the experimental conditions. The conditions are as follows:\n\nOil Condition: \u201cAs part of this survey, we are also providing important information to Ugandans about finances in Uganda. In next few years, government agencies of Uganda will receive at least five trillion shillings. This money will come from the sale of the oil that was recently discovered in Uganda. This money will become part of the Ugandan government budget. Lawmakers and the President are supposed to use the money to improve the lives of Ugandans.\u201d\n\nTax Condition: \u201cAs part of this survey, we are also providing important information to Ugandans about finances in Uganda. In next few years, government agencies of Uganda will receive at least five trillion shillings. This money will come from taxes on wages and purchases that will be paid by all Ugandans. This money will become part of the Ugandan government budget. Lawmakers and the President are supposed to use the money to improve the lives of Ugandans.\u201d\n\nAid through Government Condition: \u201cAs part of this survey, we are also providing important information to Ugandans about finances in Uganda. In next few years, government agencies of Uganda will receive at least five trillion shillings. This money will come from aid given by foreign governments. This money will become part of the Ugandan government budget. Lawmakers and the President are supposed to use the money to improve the lives of Ugandans.\u201d\n\nAid through NGOs Condition: \u201cAs part of this survey, we are also providing important information to Ugandans about finances in Uganda. In next few years, non-governmental organizations of Uganda will receive at least five trillion shillings. This money will come from foreign governments and go DIRECTLY to non-governmental organizations, not to the central government.  Non-governmental organizations are supposed to use the money to improve the lives of Ugandans.\u201d\n\nSURVEY AND KEY OUTCOMES OF INTEREST\n\nFollowing the experimental condition text, subjects will be asked a series of questions about how government money should be spent, how it is likely to be spent, and what the effects of the money on Uganda are likely to be. The questions will simultaneously serve to reinforce the treatment and to assess the effects of treatments on responses. The reactions to the survey questions, as well as actions taken in the behavioral outcomes of interest, will be compared across experimental conditions. Consistent with our discussion above, the key outcomes of interest are organized into three groups that correspond to the three causal mechanisms thought to produce the resource curse: the spending effect, the repression effect, and the accountability effect. \n\nCitizen Behavioral Outcomes\n\nThe experiment also incorporates behavioral responses in which subjects can substantiate their stated preferences by undertaking actions that impose personal costs. After the survey, subjects will have the opportunity to voice their support for or opposition to a petition calling for an independent agency to track the revenues. Subjects will also be invited to send an SMS text message reinforcing their position to their MP. Finally, they will be invited to donate the money paid them for taking part in the survey to watchdog groups promoting government accountability. MPs will be invited to sign a statement of support for a sovereign wealth fund.\n \n1.

There are several organizations in Uganda that work to make it easier for ordinary Ugandans to see how development funds are spent. At the beginning of the survey, we gave you 500 shillings to compensate you for the time it has taken to answer our questions. Now, we would like to know if you would like to donate to one of those organizations. You may choose to donate to Action Aid Uganda, Transparency International Uganda, or a third organization of your choosing. If you would like to donate, please give me the amount of money you would like to donate and which organization you would like to donate to.  If you do donate, your money will be used to help reduce corruption and improve the lives of ordinary Ugandans.   \n\n7A. ENUMERATOR: How much money did the respondent give you?

Other Organization\n\nCitizen Survey Outcomes\n\nThe following is a battery of questions that will be asked after the vignette, and represents the key outcome measures that will be used to assess whether respondents view hold different expectations for different revenue streams. They organized by the causal mechanism they are designed to test. Because spending and repression effects are ultimately a decision by elites about how to allocate resources, it is possible to observe both, one, or neither. We therefore consider these effects together. Some questions measure whether people think one is more likely than the other, while others ask them about the likelihood of each occurring independently of the other. \n\nQuestions:\n\nWe would now like to ask you some questions about what you think will happen when government [agencies/non-governmental organizations] receive five trillion shillings from [oil/taxes/aid].\n\n1. How likely is it that this money will make the government less willing to tolerate opposition and differences of opinion?\n\nA. Very unlikely\nB. Unlikely\nC. Somewhat unlikely\nD. Somewhat likely\nE. Likely\nF. Very likely\nG. Don't know\nH. Refuse\n\n2. List Experiment Question: Now I would like you to think about what may happen to the new revenue available to [government agencies/non-governmental organizations], which is coming from [oil/taxes/aid]. I am going to read you a list of things that may or may not happen with this new revenue. After I am done, I would like you to tell me HOW MANY of these things will probably happen. Do not tell me which ones you experienced, only HOW MANY.   ENUMERATOR: Read the following list of things to the respondent. Read them SLOWLY. Once you are done, ask the respondent if he or she would like you to read them again. If they answer yes, do so. Sometimes there will be four items, at other times only three. Read ONLY the items on the list. Mark the number they tell you in the box below.  \n\nA. Most of the [oil/tax/aid] money will be used to bring development to Uganda.  \nB. The [oil/tax/aid] money will bring conflict to Uganda.  \nC. Some Ugandans will benefit from the [oil/tax/aid] money, but others will not. \nD. [List experiment item, randomly assigned] Politicians will use the [oil/tax/aid] money to do favors for people and try to win their votes.\n\n3. How do you think the money should be distributed?

I understand that the creation of such a fund would entail the creation of an independent body that would manage and invest the revenues that are collected. I also understand that, every year, the fund would be required to publicly report its income and investments in order to promote transparency. I support the creation of such a fund and hope that it will bring greater development and prosperity to Uganda.\u201d\n\nMP Survey Outcomes\n\n1.

Don\u2019t know\n\nDATA ANALYSIS\n\nWe will perform data analysis on the outcomes of interest clustered according to the three categories of repression, accountability, and spending. We will begin the analysis using simple difference-in-means tests. We will supplement the difference-in-means results with robustness checks using logit and ordered probit regression analysis using standard demographic covariates as controls. These techniques will be used to assess the main between-subjects treatment effects of the four experimental conditions.\n\nGiven that we suspect that treatment effects may vary across demographic categories and geographic locations, we will also perform subgroup analysis for the following categories:\n\n1. Perceptions of high vs. low corruption\n2. Oil districts vs. non-oil districts\n3. Districts with high vs. low aid receipts\n4. Political party affiliation\n5. Ethnic affiliation (in President\u2019s tribe or not)\n\nGiven potential issues with multiple comparisons, we will examine effects of the treatments on families of outcomes, conditional on learning that the variables that we project will make up each family indeed load on the same dimension (when using factor analysis). We will construct inverse covariance-weighted indices as suggested by Anderson (2008) and test for treatment effects on the different families of outcomes. The families include subject political action, perceived consequences, projected visibility of the resource spending, and the expected beneficiaries of the funding. The families conjoin the following items from the survey instrument:\n\nAction: Importance of tracking the funding, willingness to pay taxes to create an independent tracking agency, amount willing to pay per month in taxes to support the agency, willingness to sign a petition anonymously in favor of the agency, willingness to sign the petition by name, actually signing the petition, willingness to send an SMS message in support of the agency, and actually sending the SMS.\n\nConsequences: Subject projections of funding used for repression, perceptions that the money will become a prize to be won, perceptions that it will help opposition parties, perceptions that money will be used for politicians in elections.\n\nBeneficiaries: Perceptions that the money will help make ordinary people\u2019s lives better, help the subjects\u2019 families, help the subjects\u2019 communities, help the economy, help the NRM, and help the central government.\n\nContact: Subjects\u2019 self-reported likelihood that they will contact a village elder, a sub-county official, or their member of parliament; Subjects self-reported propensity to march in a demonstration or change which party they vote for.\n\nThese families of outcomes will be analyzed using inverse-covariance weighted indices (Anderson 2008), which optimally aggregate information from several variables that load on a single common factor. In addition, we will also apply a Bonferroni correction in order to control the Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER). We will also present the results of the indices\u2019 constituent variables to demonstrate which individual measures are contributing most to the significance (or non-significance) of a given family. We have chosen the particular families outlined above because they represent key dimensions along which existing work in the resource-curse literature suggest we should see treatment effects. For example, our working assumption is that for those families that measure a willingness to take political action or contact elected officials, we should see the tax condition yield higher values.", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "Uganda", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Registration prior to researcher access to outcome data", "extra": []}, "timestamp": 41821.56422453704}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": 41828.0, "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "This is a mock write-up of a replication study solicited from International Studies Quarterly for their blog.

Crowdsourcing platforms allow a multitude of stakeholders including policy practitioners, civil society advocates, and ordinary citizens to engage in the policymaking process. Despite crowdsourcing\u2019s obvious appeal as a research and policy tool, there is relatively little existing knowledge of incentives that stimulate \u201cthe crowd\u2019s\u201d willingness to participate. Our experiment is designed to explore the most effective strategies to induce potential knowledge holders to provide information under non-emergency conditions. To this end, we will seek to determine how to entice Members of Parliament in seven African countries to provide information on Chinese-funded development projects in or near their constituency district.\n\nIncentives for crowdsourcing\n\nDifferent types of contributors have varying incentives for participating in crowdsourcing initiatives, including monetary or other material rewards, self or issue-interests (calling the police or fire-department could be considered contributing information to a crowdsourcing platform), or to enhance one\u2019s reputation. For example, a study on emergency crowdsourcing during the Haitian earthquake demonstrated that despite their diverse background, knowledge holders were motivated by both monetary and social incentives (Ramchurn et al 2013; Zook et al 2010). Inhabitants of the disaster zone would provide selective representations of local situations in order to facilitate on-the-ground rescue work, and the distant aid agencies could also provide tools and information that are important to emergency response via the crowdsourcing platform.  Different actors can also play important roles to incentivize crowdsourcing. Donor partner countries are in a position to present the advantages and opportunities of crowdsourced initiatives and incentivize their partner governments to support, or at least permit crowdsourcing (Bott & Young 2012).\n\nIn the absence of an emergency, the incentives for crowdsourcing information provision are more complicated to identify. Empirical evidence from studies on the social psychology of crowdsourcing identify three categories of incentives: extrinsic incentives (such as monetary payment or punishments), intrinsic incentives (such as inherent generosity or procrastination), and reputational incentives (such as reciprocity, publicity and praise). Among three types of incentives, the extrinsic incentives are usually considered the most effective, but may crowd out intrinsic motivations. However, there is still evidence regarding the power of intrinsic and reputational incentives in motivating participation in crowdsourcing, and prior research has identified that the combination of all three types of incentives harnesses the maximum amount of engagement in crowdsourcing (Findley et al 2012; Feldman 2005; Tirole 2006; Frey 2001; Kreps 1997). Whether the extrinsic incentive is stronger than the intrinsic incentive depends on the specific circumstances, such as the ambiguity of task and the strength of relevant social norm. The theory of Motivation Crowding Effects also suggest that while the external monetary incentives and punishments generally undermine intrinsic motivation, under identifiable conditions they may also strengthen existing intrinsic motivation. The impact of combining multiple incentives is also supported by the results of several randomized field experiment in development economics (Olken et al 2012; Banerjee et al 2010; Ashraf et al 2011).  For example, Olken et al. found that the combination of financial and non-financial incentivizing treatments would increase Indonesian midwives\u2019 effort in the provision of public health service, while the single factor of monetary compensation has no significant impact on their behavior.\n\nCrowdsourcing mechanisms\n\nSeveral papers have studied how crowdsourcing incentive structures affect participation. (Brabham 2010; Lakhani et al. 2007; Lietsala & Joutsen 2007). Empirical evidence shows that the type of technology used to elicit crowd feedback can affect the level of intrinsic reward a person gets when participates in a crowdsourcing effort (Ruggiero 2000; Yang et al 2012). All else being equal, crowdsourcing initiatives that are more engaging for participants will be more successful. These findings are consistent with the three categories of incentives. The low transaction costs and far reach of the internet make it an ideal platform for crowdsourcing by strengthening the reputational payoff of content contribution. For instance, users voluntarily provide information to websites \u2013 such as YouTube, Facebook, or blogs \u2013 because they are rewarded with a desired degree of social notoriety. The spread of smartphones further solidifies the internet as the preferred crowdsourcing platform by lowering the barriers for users to contribute information. This reduces procrastination, which is considered an obstacle to intrinsic motivation. \n\nMoreover, certain crowdsourcing mechanisms emphasize intrinsic motivations such as enjoyment of social proof and over monetary rewards. A typical example is Lietsala and Joutsen\u2019s research on the production of Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning, the world\u2019s first feature-length film created through crowdsourcing. The survey on 130 community members and moviemakers shows that among all incentives to participation, most people are motivated by the fun of making a movie, while the desire for monetary reward is the least selected answer.\n\nActivation energy\n\nGiven the research result that a crowdsourcing campaign\u2019s incentive structure and technological platform play central roles in eliciting participation, we are interested in distinguishing the mechanisms that provide high motivation for participation. As we consider crowdsourcing to be a type of voluntary, goal-directed behavior, the psychological concept of activation energy is helpful in explaining the motivation of \u201cthe crowd\u201d. Psychologists define activation energy as an initial investment of energy required to start an active behavior. Thus, tasks requiring lower activation energy to start are more likely to be completed (Achor 2011, Csikszentmihalyi 1997). In other words, crowdsourcing mechanism which requires low activation energy would entice more potential knowledge holders to contribute information because the process is easier to complete. For example, Netflix users are much more willingly to rate movies by clicking star rating than writing a review (Nielsen 2006). The effect of ease-of-use on people\u2019s effort to complete a task is supported by various studies on cognitive and social psychology (Davis 1989, Shin 2006, Webster & Hackley 1997). According to Davis, a technology is more actively used when it is easy to use and navigate. Similarly, learning tools designed to facilitate learner\u2019s engagement are expected to increase the degree of understanding and continuation. \n\nThere is also empirical evidence that facilitating the participation process will encourage people to undertake costly actions (Behavioural Insights Team 2012; Behavioural Insights Team 2013; Kane et al 2004). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted to test the effectiveness of different messages designed for motivating behavioral changes, such as increasing charitable giving or reducing tax fraud. The research results reveal that the process should be made as easy as possible, and the key messages must be easy to identify and understand. For example, people are more likely to pay their tax when a form with information already held is provided, and simple message language is proved to be more persuasive than complex messages. Also, the most incentivizing message is personalized, locally relevant, and framed within the context of a greater good or social norm. Our contribution to the literature on crowdsourcing will expand on previous research by testing how varying the response mechanism influences participation.\n\nReferences\n\nAchor, Shawn.

We will also explore whether the perceived salience of the information being supplied or requested influences responses. If the literature on activation energy provides explanatory purchase, we expect the treatments that reduce the cognitive burden of responding will elicit more information. Therefore, we expect that MPs receiving a link to a survey that guides them through entry of information on Chinese financed development projects will provide the most information, followed by those who are asked to provide information in an email response, then by those who are directed to enter information directly onto project pages on china.aiddata.org. Additionally, if the information request is more locally relevant to the personal and professional background of the elites, we expect that these treatments will be met with better response rates. We expect that MPs who see the name of their district in the subject line of an email will be more likely to provide information than will those MPs who see the name of their country in the email subject line. The use of a full factorial design will also allow us to determine whether these two different strategies can be complementary or counter-productive when used in tandem.\n\nConsistent with the reasoning outlined above, we predict that MPs are more likely to contribute information on Chinese financed development projects when they are asked to crowdsource information that is perceived as salient and in an easy-to-use response format. In the context of our treatment groups, this means that we expect MPs who receive an email with (1) their district identified in the subject line of the email and (2) a link to a survey in the email will be most responsive and that MPs who receive an email with (1) their country identified in the subject line of the email and (2) directions to enter project information via a link to china.aiddata.org will be least responsive.\n\nTable 1: Expectations of MP Responses Across Several Outcomes\n\nEffect Type:\nActivation Energy (Ease of Response)\nHierarchy of MP Responsiveness:\nSurvey > Email Response > Website Entry\n\nEffect Type:\nSalience (Local Relevance)\nHierarchy of MP Responsiveness:\nMP District > Country", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Crowdsourcing Chinese Aid Information", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Perla, Lyness, Scott, Fu, Napier, Nielson, Parks", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Researchers", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "Outcome Measure\n\nWe will collect data on three outcomes of interest: 1) the open rate, or how many MPs open the email, 2) the substantive response rate, or how many MPs responded with project-specific information, and 3) the percentage of projects that an MP provided information for, which will measure how much project information MPs were willing or able to provide.\n\nTreatment and Control Conditions\n\nTo test the effectiveness of different strategies at inducing crowdsourcing responses, we will send tailored emails to each subject asking them to contribute information and opinions about Chinese-funded development projects in or near their district. Email templates for each group are attached. This experiment will benefit from a full factorial design. The first factor will require altering the format in which subjects are asked to contribute data. For the control group, the email will contain a list of projects in or near the MP\u2019s district and provide a hyperlink for each project page on china.aiddata.org. MPs will be asked to review existing information for accuracy and completeness, and provide feedback through the comments section of the project page. For the first treatment group, the email will contain a list of projects in or near the recipient\u2019s district, and MP will be directed to a Qualtrics survey that will list the projects again. Each page of the survey will pose a different question and ask respondents to identify the projects about which they possess additional information. The Qualtrics survey will include both direct and open-ended questions. For the second treatment group, MPs will receive a list of projects and 4 accompanying questions that we have determined to require relatively little energy to answer. The MPs will be asked to submit responses directly into a response email. If an MP replies, we will follow up with four additional questions that require a greater deal of time investment from the respondent. If it is truly the case that activation energy shapes a person\u2019s propensity to contribute to a crowdsourcing initiative, we expect response rates for the second round of emails to drop significantly.\n\nTwo weeks after the initial emails are sent, MPs who have not responded will receive a tailored reminder email that is very similar to the original email they received. One week after the second reminder email, MPs who have still not responded will receive a second reminder email with a specified deadline for their response.\n\nThe other key component of the full factorial design is a test of whether and how changes in the content of email subject lines impact our outcome measures: email open rates, substantive response rates, and the completeness of responses. Across all conditions, we will randomly assign each MP to receive a \u201ccountry-level\u201d email subject line or a \u201cdistrict-level\u201d subject line. The country-level subject line will read, \u201cHow many Chinese-funded projects is (Country) implementing?\u201d The district-level subject line will read, \u201cHow many Chinese-funded projects is (District) implementing?\u201d We anticipate the district keyword will signal a higher level of salience to MPs. By comparing the outcome measures of the two groups across all treatments, we will attempt to test whether manipulating the perceived salience of an email subject affects the willingness of MPs to engage and to supply information.\n\nWe will assign each MP with six projects that are in or near their district. Every MP will receive at least two national projects to ensure a level of standardization across respondents. To assign the local projects, we mapped the electoral and/or administrative districts of each country in conjunction with AidData\u2019s geocoded Chinese-funded development projects using QGIS software. Our research has indicated that administrative districts are often comprised of multiple electoral districts; therefore electoral districts are more localized than administrative districts. In order to be able ask MPs about projects within and near their electoral district, we joined the geocoded dataset to the district shapefiles. The outcome rendered a dataset that lists project locations and the corresponding electoral districts.\n\nNext, all the project locations with a geocoded precision code of 1 (indicating an exact location) will be assigned to the MP that represents the listed district. Projects assigned in this manner will be recorded as \u201cin\u201d the MP\u2019s district. If a project\u2019s electoral division cannot be assigned to an MP, we will rely on the larger administrative district to assign projects. These projects will be classified as \u201cnear\u201d the MP\u2019s district. \n\nIf certain MPs are assigned fewer than 5 projects (including the two national projects assigned across all MPs), we will assign regional projects (indicated by a variable precision code). National projects are identified by the precision code \u201c6\u201d or \u201c8.\u201d  \n\nAssignment of projects to MPs has already been completed for our first target country, Rwanda.\n\nSubject Pool\n\n  \tOur research subjects will consist of current members parliament (MPs) in seven African countries: Ghana (178 MPs), Uganda (379 MPs), Botswana (58 MPs), Rwanda (104 MPs), Namibia (60 MPs), Kenya (266 MPs), and South Africa (400 MPs). All seven countries have English as an official language, and they vary in terms of wealth and regime type. The size of the subject pool is believed to be large enough (n=1,445) to draw a statistically significant conclusion.\n\nSubjects will be recruited for participation in the survey based on their status as MPs in the seven selected countries. We constructed the subject pool based on publicly available information. We first extracted contact and covariate information for each MP from the parliament or government websites where available, and relied on additional online information repositories when unavailable. \n\nThough we restricted our sample to English speaking African countries with readily available contact information, we believe our sample to be a representative subset of African countries. There is a wide spectrum of regime type, ranging from the fairly stable democracies of Namibia and Botswana, to mixed regimes (anocracies) like Kenya and autocracies like Uganda and Rwanda. In terms of economic development, there is again heterogeneity in the sample with Botswana and South Africa representing some of the strongest economies on the continent, Ghana emblematic of emerging economies in Africa, and Uganda representing countries with less robust economic growth. We hope the diversity of the sample will allow us to examine whether our crowdsourcing program is robust across institutional contexts or only suited to certain regimes. \n\nRandomization\n\nTo balance on key observable covariates, we employed a stratified randomization procedure. Before randomly assigning experimental conditions to the subjects, we stratified subjects based on covariates that might be expected influence their knowledge of Chinese development projects. The blocking strata included the nationality of MP (Uganda, Kenya, Ghana, Rwanda, Namibia, Botswana, South Africa) and the number of projects in their district (0, 1-9, 10 or more). After blocking into each strata, we assigned by computerized randomization one of six treatment combinations (2 possible groups within the subject line, 3 possible groups for the email body).  \n\nData Analysis Protocol\n\n \tBased on the stratification criteria, we identified 21 strata as possible combinations of 7 countries and 3 levels of local Chinese-fund project density. The prevalence of project covariate coding as below:\n\n0= no Chinese-funded project in the MP\u2019s electoral district\n1= 1-9 Chinese-funded projects in the MP\u2019s electoral district\n2= 10 or more Chinese funded projects in the MP\u2019s electoral district\n\n   \t We will use Mailchimp, an email marketing service, to distribute each email treatment. Mailchimp also tracks respondents who open the email and the links that they click within the body of the email. The open rate, one of our key outcome measures, will be measured using Mailchimp statistics. We will code and analyze the dependent variables (DV) using the following methods:\n\nDV1 - Open rate (binary variable): 0 = no emails were opened; 1 = at least 1 email was opened.\nDV2 - Provision of substantive response (binary variable): 0= no substantive response was provided; 1= there is provision of substantive information about the project; N/A= emails unopened. The provision of substantive information is defined as either responding to one or more questions or providing additional contact as required.\nDV3 - Number of projects with information provided: value = the number of projects where information is provided.\n\nAs a randomization check, we will perform logistic regression analyses to learn if the covariates (nationality of MP and number of projects in MP\u2019s district) were significantly associated with the probability of assignment to any one condition versus the others. \n\n  \tAs a first cut at data analysis, we will perform difference-of-means estimation for all three outcome variables. We also perform subgroup analysis within the three strata of Chinese project density. For the open rate, we will perform subgroup analysis for each country independently. \n\n\tLogistic regressions for the open rate and provision of substantive response will supplement the difference-in-means analysis. Covariates for country and density of Chinese aid projects will be employed in the regressions to check robustness. For the number of projects with a substantive response we will use zero-inflated count regression analysis with the same control variables. Because the second and third dependent variables, provision of substantive response and number of projects with substantive information, are conditional on response we will also employ a two-stage model to estimate the complier average causal effect (CACE, see Gerber and Green 2012).\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX: Email Templates (First contact and Reminder Emails)\n\nControl Group\nCONTROL: First Contact\nSUBJECT: How Many Chinese-Financed Projects is [Country/District] Receiving?\nDear Honorable [[Name]]:\nI am writing on behalf of AidData, an organization that provides information about development projects that could positively or negatively impact local communities in [[Country]].

If so, which projects? Check all that apply.\n\u00b7                  Loan for Kivu Belt road project: http://china.aiddata.org/projects/30353\nOn December 27, 2012 the Rwandan government passed a law authorizing the loan agreement that was signed in China on July 20, 2012. The loan is through China's ExIm Bank for a total amount of 113,409230.63 US Dollars. The loan has an interest rate of 1.5 percent, a maturity of twenty years, and a seven year grace period. The total value of the project is 320 USD million with the remainder of the funding coming through loans from the African Development Bank and Arab Development Bank. China Roads and Bridges Corporation is responsible for implementing the project with the Canadian firm CIMA overseeing construction. The entire Kivu Belt road will cover 185 km; the Chinese loan will cover two sections of the whole project, one connecting Mwityazo of Nyamasheke district with Ruvumbu of Karongi district and another section connecting Ruvumbu to Kibuye. \n\u00b7                  Construction of Cement Factory: http://china.aiddata.org/projects/2009\nOn January 14, 2009, Rwandan President Paul Kagame and Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi agreed for China to fund the construction and operation of the cement factory (CIMERWA) in Bugarama, Rwanda. Chinese company, Pengfei Group Co. Ltd oversaw the construction of the plant. As of October 2010, 30% of the price of the plant had been paid and construction had begun. \n\u00b7                  Kigali Road Network Rehabilitation Project: http://china.aiddata.org/projects/2014\nFollowing a bilateral summit in Beijing on July 28-29, 2009, China gave Rwanda an interest-free, 219 million RMB loan for the rehabilitation of the Kigali road network. Rwandan Foreign Affairs Permanent Secretary Eugene Munyakayanza and Chinese Vice-Minister in the Ministry of Commerce Fu Ziying led the Rwandan and Chinese delegations that signed of the loan agreement between the Rwandan Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning and the Exim Bank of China. The start and end dates of the project are unknown.\n\u00b7                  Rehabilitation of the Urban Roads in Kigali: http://china.aiddata.org/projects/955\nOn October 24, 2008 in Rwanda, Chinese Ambassador Sun Shuzhong and the Rwandan Finance Minister signed an agreement for a concessional loan of 30.79 million loan for the construction of a Kigali municipal road reconstruction project. The road was constructed by China Road and Bridge Corporation. The 36km road neared completion in April 2011, with an estimated one month left before completion. \n\u00b7                  Construction of Ministry of Foreign Affairs Headquarters: http://china.aiddata.org/projects/1886\nIn December 2006, China began construction on a new Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MINAFET) headquarters worth $7.66 million USD in Kigali. The project was implemented by Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co. Ltd (BCEG). On January 14, 2009, the Chinese Foreign Minister, Yang Jiechi, handed the office block over to the MINAFET.\n\u00b7                  Loan for the Construction of a Fibre-optic network in Uganda, Tanzania, and Rwanda: http://china.aiddata.org/projects/30108\nIn 2007, Uganda and the Exim Bank of China signed an agreement for a loan worth 106 million USD for the construction of the National Data Transmission Backbone Infrastructure (NBI) and the funding of the Electronic Government Infrastructure (EGI) initiative (some earlier sources have indicated the loan was for 120 million USD). The loan has an interest rate of 2%, a grace period of 5 years and a maturity of 20 years. The loan is being used to fund the construction of a fiber-optic infrastructure linking the country to surrounding countries as well as government ministries to each other. The project is being implemented by China's Huawei Technologies in three phases. \n\nThe first phase was concluded in 2007, connecting 27 government ministries in the Kampala Metroplitan Area, and Entebbe, Jinja, Mukono, and Bombo as well as 5 transmission sites. The second phase was concluded in 2011, constructing a datacentre, beginning a pilot project for messaging and collaboration tools, and laying, 1,548 kilometers of fiber-optic cable linking Luwero, Nakasongola, Masindi, Gulu, Nimule, Lira, Soroti, Kumi, Mbale, Tororo, Malaba, Busia, Hoima, Kyenjojo, Fort Portal, Kasese, Bushenyi, and Mbarara, including 17 transmission sites. The third phase will lay 307 kilometers of cable connecting Katuna, Kabale, Ntungamo, Masaka, and Mutukula through 3 transmissions sites, linking Uganda with Rwanda and Tanzania. \nNEXT\n[Page 2]\nWhich of these projects have been generally well received by the constituents in your district?\n\n\u00b7                  Loan for Kivu Belt road project\n\u00b7                  Construction of Cement Factory\n\u00b7                  Kigali Road Network Rehabilitation Project\n\u00b7                  Rehabilitation of the Urban Roads in Kigali\n\u00b7                  Construction of Ministry of Foreign Affairs Headquarters\n\u00b7                  Loan for the Construction of a Fibre-optic network in Uganda, Tanzania, and Rwanda\n[Page 3]\nDo you know of any individuals or organizations associated with any of these projects?

However, as the initial disaster evolved into a long-term development crisis, the inefficiencies of aid efforts became increasingly visible despite a large, well-rounded, high-profile international presence and many attempts at donor coordination.  Though donor harmonization efforts are believed to increase the efficiency of aid allocation, many development professionals in Haiti at the time were seemingly uninterested, or at least unable to coordinate aid.  While sitting in on a weekly coordination meeting between 60 relief workers, journalist Janet Reitman observed \u201ccomplaining\u201d and lack of dialogue, noting that \u201cin the end, nothing was decided\u201d (2011).  Functionally, these meetings could have facilitated a more effective allocation of aid in the midst of the crisis and saved lives in the process.  Instead, donors were unmotivated to participate, causing these efforts to devolve into \u201can exercise in futility,\u201d a description that could be applied all-too-often in multi-stakeholder international development efforts (Reitman 2011). \n     This experience exemplifies tragic consequences of donor fragmentation in times when aid matters most.  A more coordinated aid strategy could have at least moderated the chaos of Haiti\u2019s aid management in the midst of a national disaster and would likely have expedited the recovery process.  This case illustrates the dire need for a new model of cooperation across donors both in times of crisis and for long term growth and development in nations receiving aid.  \n      Motivated both by the mandate for coordination as defined in international agreements, as well as these past challenges, we explore different attitudes and practices in the development community with respect to donor coordination.  Our research question centers around whether donors respond to efforts to increase coordination and how they might be motivated to do so.  More specifically, does referencing credible evidence on the benefits of donor harmonization induce project managers to take steps towards coordination?  Does offering an incentive of public credit or invoking career incentives induce participation among donors?  While opinions as to why fragmentation exists are plentiful, scoping these ideas will be an essential component of any effort to \u201cde-mystify\u201d donor coordination.  Thus, this experiment is as much about identifying problems as it is about proposing solutions.  Through an email and survey-based randomized evaluation, we will attempt to address these questions as well as identify barriers to coordination and whether donor institutions are actively encouraging coordination in the field.\n     In light of the growing emphasis on aid effectiveness and transparency in international development, research and policy communities have promoted donor coordination as a key element of this endeavor.  The 2005 Paris Declaration called for better \u201charmonization\u201d across donors and suggested that development efforts should be \u201cmore transparent and collectively effective.\u201d  The declaration boldly states that improving aid effectiveness is not only \u201cnecessary,\u201d but also \u201cfeasible across all aid modalities.\u201d  This operational tenet implies a great need for improvements in harmonization and collaboration across the spectrum of both donor and recipient countries; thus, the declaration develops a narrative for a new paradigm for foreign aid to that effect.  Subsequent conferences at Accra in 2008 and Busan in 2011 continued the discussion of aid effectiveness, together forming the \u201cParis Agenda\u201d which highlights donor coordination as an essential element of aid improvement (Bigsten & Tengstam 2014).\n    Outside these official channels, researchers have continued the discussion of the mechanics of donor fragmentation and its impact on the effectiveness of foreign aid delivery.  The issue of how to address the effectiveness of foreign aid has been heavily debated topic both in policy and academic communities.  Through the years it has become apparent that foreign aid in of itself is not a silver bullet for global poverty, bearing only a weak relationship with improved development outcomes (Bourgignon & Sundberg 2007; Easterly et al, 2003; Rajan and Subramainian, 2005).  In the literature, recommendations for a renewed emphasis on country ownership of aid and performance-based allocation highlight the nuances of coordination strategies between donors and target countries.  A Rahman and Sawada study in 2010 utilized OECD CRS data to study incidences of \u201cfree-riding\u201d among donors.  The empirical results of the study suggest that competition among donors generates an insufficient supply of foreign aid, though coordination efforts alone may not solve this problem without accompanying reforms in the structure of donor incentives.  One way to incentivize coordination may be to create a \u201crecognition\u201d incentive that publicly names donors participating in coordination.  The resulting public and social stigma would pressure donors into coordinating at the risk of appearing unresponsive to calls for harmonization. \nIn addition to suggesting a change in donor incentives, the Paris Agenda puts the burden on both donors and recipients to coordinate and reform the aid allocation process.  Some have argued that it is the call for improved governance and management on the part of aid recipients embedded in the Paris Agenda that holds the greatest potential for improving aid effectiveness (Rogerson 2005).\n     Moreover, Knack and Rahman (2007) find in their research on donor fragmentation that \u201ccompetitive donor practices...erode administrative capacity in recipient country governments.\u201d Proliferation of aid increases transaction costs to recipient governments, \u201coverwhelming\u201d recipients\u2019 ability to effectively organize and administer aid (Knack & Sawada 2012).  In addition to decreasing the value of aid, proliferation has been shown to negatively impact recipient countries\u2019 economic growth (Kimura et al. 2007).  Countries with higher amounts of concentrated aid appear to demonstrate increased aid effectiveness, though there appear to be diminishing returns to concentration.  Kimura even states that \u201clack of international aid coordination leads to the lack of ownership and lower capacities of aid recipients and hinders their growth potential\u201d (2007).  However, the impact of donor coordination requires much further research: as well as lowering transaction costs for recipients, coordination could adversely impact effectiveness by introducing the free-rider problem among coordinating donors (Kimura et al. 2007).\n     A potential solution to aid proliferation is concentrating aid, or encouraging donors to focus on particular regions or countries (Acharya et al. 2006).  While coordination is another possible solution, Acharya finds that it faces high negotiation costs as do other proposed remedies such as sector-wide approaches (SWAps), budget support, and sector specialization (2006).  Some scholars remain even more skeptical, claiming that many econometric studies of aid effectiveness are susceptible to sample modification or additional controls and are thus fragile (Roodman 2007).  Pursuing more randomized field experiments may help alleviate some of these concerns in the literature on donor coordination, impact on recipient countries, and overall aid effectiveness. \n     It has been noted that coordination reduces transaction costs for donors and provides better allocation of donor dollars across recipient countries, though this assumes donors\u2019 primary goal is the eradication of global poverty (Bigsten and Tengstam 2014; Lawson 2009).  In fact, divergent strategic interests and differing structures of bureaucratic incentives among aid agencies may be significant obstacles for donor coordination (Winters 2012).  Studies on career motivation identify individual and situational or organizational characteristics as important factors of career decisions and behaviors (London 1983).  The more importance an individual places on his or her career and the more an organization incentivizes advancement, the more likely individuals are to behave in ways that organizations deem optimal.  For example, if a donor organization links coordination to career advancement and promotion, individuals may be more likely to participate in harmonization activities (if their individual career motivations are aligned accordingly).  \n     Shortly after the Paris Declaration, Bigsten (2006) suggested that differences across donors in terms of their respective rules and procedures complicate the aid allocation process and raises costs overall.  In many cases, work is duplicated in the process of needs assessments and evaluations.  Coordination problems may also be compounded by procedural nuances and language barriers.  In a worst case scenario, the inefficiencies generated by donor fragmentation can undermine governance in recipient countries by overburdening governments and distorting incentives.  At the time of the Paris Declaration and Accra Agenda, transaction costs were identified as a key obstacle to aid efficiency.  Indeed, addressing the issue of transaction costs had been considered \u201cone of the fundamental objectives of the Paris Declaration.\u201d  However, throughout the implementation process for the Agenda, it has become apparent that identifying the true nature of these transaction costs, much less addressing them, is easier said than done.\n     On a broader scale, despite the notion that harmonization would likely lead to better development outcomes, coordinating across donors continues to be more widely embraced in theory than in practice.  A 2010 US Congressional Report admitted that despite support for goals outlined in the Paris Declaration, the US lacks \u201ca comprehensive strategy for donor coordination.\u201d  Indeed, Aldasoro et al. (2010) notes that the US has experienced \u201ca systematic decrease in coordination\u201d since the advent of the Paris Agenda.  Across all donors, Nunnencamp, Ohler, & Thiele (2013) find that \u201caid fragmentation persisted after the Paris Declaration and coordination among donors has even weakened.\u201d  Despite more overlap in aid, coordination shortcomings may be attributed to information asymmetries, non-altruistic goals of aid, and the proliferation of many diverse donor organizations on the international scene (Nunnencamp et al. 2013).  \n     Additionally, donors may be less willing to engage in coordination if they fear it may reduce country ownership of aid, another key principle outlined in the Paris Declaration (Winters 2012).  In a study of harmonization obstacles to local governance aid in Indonesia, Winters finds that donors themselves create the barriers to coordination by hindering coordination of agencies within recipient governments (2012).  Using an innovative network model connecting donor organizations, recipient countries, and aid sectors, Coscia, Hausmann & Hidalgo (2013) find coordination achieves roughly 60% of its maximum potential and advocate a more decentralized approach to coordination among donors.  It is possible that donor harmonization is now being viewed as an unattainable, even annoying, ideal that is irksome to development professionals.  The usage of the term \u201ccoordination\u201d may be problematic as it is rapidly becoming \u201cone of the most tired and deceptive terms in the business\u201d (Acharya et al. 2006).  This experiment seeks to explain the nature of the dissonance between rhetoric and reality and whether it is an issue of motivation or simply a lack of appropriate tools and methodologies to facilitate cooperation.\n         It is apparent that donor norms articulated in the agenda of Paris, Accra, and Busan along with other international initiatives embrace the notion of increased harmonization across donors as a way to improve development outcomes.  However, as the literature above suggests, there exists a significant disparity between policy ideals and practice.  In light of these observations, a number of questions emerge as to the feasibility of coordination at an operational level.  Despite the generally favorable view of donor coordination in the literature, it remains unclear how individuals within the donor community view these international initiatives, the issue of coordination, and the role they play in facilitating it.  Using an experimental approach, our study addresses existing attitudes toward coordination at the project management level in an attempt to understand the nature of the disconnect between international standards and their implementation.  In short, we are asking if project managers inclined to coordinate, what motivates them to do so, and, if motivated, whether sufficient tools and mechanisms are in place to coordinate aid efforts.\nReferences\nAcharya, Arnab, Ana Teresa Fuzzo De Lima, and Mick Moore. \"Proliferation and fragmentation: Transactions costs and the value of aid.\" The journal of development studies 42, no. 1 (2006): 1-21.\n\nAldasoro, I\u00f1aki, Peter Nunnenkamp, & Rainer Thiele. \"Less aid proliferation and more donor coordination?

Coordination is a time-intensive endeavor, requiring project managers to devote precious resources to activities in which they may not be truly motivated to participate.  We use cooperation (defined as opening the email and clicking the link to the survey) in our coordination initiative as a proxy for actual interest in coordination and willingness to coordinate, or at least recognition of a need.  By entering the survey, project managers have signaled their interest and willingness to dedicate time for coordination.\nIn this experiment, we are testing different motivations for donor coordination using two sets of hypotheses: one set based on our two control conditions, and the other based on our three treatment conditions.\nFirst, we test donor reactions to the word \u201ccoordination.\u201d Our baseline condition does not include the term \u201ccoordination\u201d anywhere and does not include any motivational treatment language. Our second control condition also does not include motivational treatment language, but email subject lines will include the term \u201ccoordination.\u201d These two control conditions will serve as comparisons for treatment conditions and will also allow for tests of whether the use of the term \u201ccoordination\u201d impacts email open rates and survey completion rates.\nThe three treatment conditions that we use in this study allow for hypotheses regarding various motivations for coordination. We expect that if (1) project managers perceive coordination as a mode to advance their careers, they will coordinate.  Our second motivational treatment implies that if (2) credible evidence supports the practice of coordination, then, when presented with that evidence, project managers will coordinate.  Our third and final motivational treatment suggests that if (3) there is public recognition tied to coordination, or alternately, public stigma tied to lack thereof, then project managers will elect to coordinate.  We hypothesize that email open rates, survey start rates, and survey completion rates will be higher in all three of these treatment conditions than in the control conditions.\n", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Motivations To Coordinate: A Field Experiment in Donor Coordination", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Stern, Dimos, Desai, Napier, Harrison, Schectman, Kaufman, Nielson", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Researchers", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "Outcome Measure\nTo adequately capture different motivational treatments and their impact on coordination efforts, we have embedded outcome measures progressively through the experiment.  The first outcome measures the email open rate, which will capture subject-line treatment effects.  This serves as a proxy for whether donors respond to attempts at coordination by measuring whether donors are at all interested in reading an email on coordination.  The subject lines of treatment emails will mention donor coordination and echo the treatments embedded in the email.  The first control email will not mention donor coordination at all in the subject line or email body, and will serve as a baseline for open rates of all emails. The second control email will have a subject line of only \u201cDonor Coordination Initiative,\u201d and will not include any motivating treatments. \n     The second outcome measures the click-rate of the survey link and other treatment-specific links, capturing the email treatment effects.  Clicking the survey link serves as a proxy for whether or not donors are motivated to coordinate conditional on what motivational treatment they have or have not received.  The language of the treatment and control emails also contains various links to scholarly evidence or AidData\u2019s website, both of which back-up claims made in the email.  Clicking these links indicates interest in gaining more knowledge about a treatment claim or AidData\u2019s organization.  \n     The third outcome measure tracks the completion rate of the survey and responses to survey questions.  The survey is separated into three \u201cpages,\u201d so partial completion will be able to be tracked.  Survey questions include descriptive information about the Task Team Leader\u2019s position, how long he or she has worked at the World Bank, the number and type of projects that he or she manages, and regional and sectoral specialization.  Subsequent questions ask respondents to identify if they are currently participating in coordination efforts and if so, how they are coordinating with other donors.  Additionally, Task Team Leaders will be asked to describe how coordination might be improved and to identify barriers and potential solutions to the problem of donor coordination.  Donors will be asked if coordinating with other organizations is encouraged at their organization and whether it factors into decisions regarding promotion or recognition.  The survey completion rate and answers to survey questions serve as a proxy for donor commitment to address an initiative to enhance coordination efforts.\nTreatment and Control Conditions\n   As articulated above, our treatments will observe three different motivations to coordinate along with two controls, one with donor coordination language, the other neutral.  The treatment language will be embedded in both email subject lines and the email body itself.  The first control email will simply seek survey information about donors and will not mention donor coordination or harmonization, as these may be \u201cbuzzwords\u201d that could be offputting to some recipients.  The subject line and email language will only mention a \u201cdonor survey\u201d to \u201clearn from development professionals about donor activities in the field.\u201d  The second control will ask participants to participate in a \u201cdonor harmonization initiative\u201d by filling out the survey.  It will reference previous donor harmonization efforts and their unclear effects via links in the treatment language text. Importantly, the two email controls will not provide other motivating language that may influence donors to coordinate.\n     Public and social stigma will be used in the first treatment by telling donors that public credit will be given to donors participating in the initiative.  A program report will be published on AidData.org, including a list of survey respondents who wish to be acknowledged for participating in this donor coordination effort.  Donors choosing not to participate may be perceived as unable to coordinate due to other demands on their time and attention, or unwilling to comply with the recommendations for increasing aid effectiveness set forth in the Paris Agenda.  From this perspective, a low response rate may still prove insightful as it continues to provide insight on what is or is not an effective approach to address coordination. \n     The second treatment will seek to motivate donors through credible, scholarly evidence indicating why coordination improves aid outcomes.  This treatment will specifically link to a 2007 study published in Journal of Development Economics by Knack and Rahman that suggests that donor fragmentation results in lower bureaucratic quality among recipients.  Because \u201cgreater donor coordination should help to improve governance in the recipient countries,\u201d donors should support coordination efforts and take the survey.\n     The final treatment will use encouragement from organizational superiors as a motivating factor for donor coordination.  The World Bank and many other donor institutions have vocalized their support of coordination efforts in the abstract, acknowledging the problems inherent in aid fragmentation.  In a speech to the World Health Assembly in May 2013, World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim stated that donor coordination should be central to the Bank\u2019s strategy, arguing that \u201c[donor] fragmentation is literally killing people. We must take action to fix it now.\u201d  By citing this quote and implying the connection between donor coordination and successful outcomes for Task Team Leaders at the World Bank, this treatment will compel respondents to become involved in coordination and click the survey.\n     In an effort to boost response rates, across all treatment and control groups, follow-up reminder emails to participate will be sent if respondents don\u2019t initially open the email.  These reminders will include relevant treatment or control language.  The survey itself will be uniform across participants.\nSubject Pool\n     Subjects will be randomly assigned to control and treatment groups from a list of World Bank Task Team Leaders (TTLs).  All subjects will be experienced employees of the World Bank with decision-making authority over project management in the field.  We expect to send survey email treatments to about 1200 potential participants.  However, the voluntary nature of participation in the survey allows participants to select in or out of the study at their own discretion, so we expect that our treatment-on-treated subject pool for the third outcome measure to be smaller.\nRandomization\n     We will use block randomization to ensure balance between the three treatment groups and two control groups.  From our pool of TTLs, we will block subjects by the aid sector of the project that the TTL managers identified in terms of World Bank sector breakdowns.  For the purposes of this experiment, including maintaining blocks of a manageable size and retaining sufficient power, we have used the 10 main sectors identified by the World Bank\u2019s sectoral categories.  We have coded the TTL portfolios in our sample accordingly using data from the primary sector of the project they manage.  In addition to sectoral blocking, we will block participants by region where they primarily work.  Projects are assigned one of seven regional codes, which we will use as the TTL\u2019s primary region of focus.\n\nData Analysis Protocol\n \tConcerns regarding the sensitivity of our treatment language to existing attitudes in the donor community have prompted us to develop a pre-test protocol to assess the appropriateness of our intervention.  Prior to launching the pilot study, we contacted 10-15 individuals at the World Bank, AidData, and other donor organizations with whom AidData has an established working relationship in order to screen our treatments, acquire feedback, and adapt the experimental design to maximize its effectiveness. We screened reaction to potential buzzwords such as \u201cdonor coordination\u201d and \u201caid harmonization\u201d and the experiment structure, and adjusted treatment language and formatting accordingly in preparation to launch the protocol.  \n     Once the pre-test results have been assessed and applied to our treatment protocol, we will launch the pilot phase to the sample population under a blocked approach to randomized assignment.  Mailchimp will be used to deliver the treatment and control emails and track click-rates of the survey and embedded links, including AidData\u2019s website, reference materials like the Paris Declaration and, in some cases, additional sources which vary by treatment (see appendix for detailed treatment language).  Qualtrics software will then be used to administer the survey and subsequently log the qualitative and binary responses from participants.\n     Thus, utilizing Mailchimp and Qualtrics, we will observe quantitative outcome measures of opening the initial email and clicking on the survey, as well as the binary, qualitative, and scalar data provided by survey responses.  Difference-in-means tests will be used to assess treatment effects across our treatment and control groups accompanied by logistic regression analysis with covariates as a robustness check.  Covariates for analysis will include gender, work experience, project location and region, sector, and project size (based on the project\u2019s budget) gathered from our survey data and baseline data on the TTLs.\nAnalysis Plan\n     To distinguish the treatment effects across our three motivational email treatment groups, we will employ difference in means tests to analyze effects for each of the experimental conditions and controls.  In order to adequately address the issue of balance across our sample and to control for any heterogeneity of outcomes, we will employ logit regression analysis with the covariates outlined above.  This serves as an attempt to statistically control for the most measurable confounds.  Planned covariates for analysis of treatment effects will include gender, number of projects a Task Team Leader has led as a proxy for experience level, as well as relevant project locations, sectors, and size.\n     The survey itself (see appendix) will provide qualitative, categorical, and binary data for further research and analysis.  The survey will be uniform across all treatment and control groups and is primarily for the purpose of our own learning.  In an effort to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying challenges associated with coordination, respondents will be provided with an opportunity to identify key obstacles and challenges, articulate their views on the issue of donor fragmentation, and their perceptions of the culture of coordination at the World Bank.  Additionally, respondents will be prompted to identify potential solutions or tools that they believe could help overcome the obstacles they have identified to facilitate improved coordination and more effective aid outcomes.  Through summary statistics and qualitative data emerging from survey responses, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the coordination debate through an examination of trends in the characteristics of respondents and frequently identified obstacles to coordination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDICES\nAppendix 1: Treatment Email and Survey Language\nControl 1:\n\nSubject Line: Donor Survey\n\nEmail:  At AidData we are undertaking a new initiative to learn from development professionals about donor activities in the field.

Subjects  play an optimal stopping game to earn money. They are randomly assigned to work as members of a group and their game is randomly generated with high or low degrees of difficulty. Difficulty will proxy for success, as described below. After playing the game, several measures of social capital are recorded. \n\n\\section{Background}\n\nThis lab experiment investigates the impact of collaborative effort and success on the formation of social capital. In the developing world, scholars and policy practioners often recommend partnership with local NGO's for development efforts. Localized and NGO-led development is said to be more effective, efficient, appropriate, democratic, and transparent than top-down efforts by governments or large international actors. More importantly for this study, scholars have also asserted that these efforts will, as a side benefit, help create social capital by organising beneficiaries into community organisations. \n\nFor example, a World Bank project in Rondonia, Brazil, distributed funds to support sustainable development projects. Funds were awarded to NGO's that were formed by local organisations in rainforest communities. These organisations were often brand-new - formed explicitly and solely to seek the funding for the community. The idea was that in addition to finding locally-appropriate development projects, the formation of these new NGO's would help create social capital by generating community organisations where none previously existed.\n\nObservational studies reach diverging conclusions on the impact of local community organisation efforts as part of development strategies. Some find no impact, some find positive effects, and others find negative effects. There is obvious endogeneity in these studies given that successful organisation may require pre-existing social capital. \n\nSeveral field experiments have tried to test this relationship, also with mixed results.\n\nWe test the independent and interactive impact of two treatments on social capital: group collaboration, and success. We use a laboratory experiment conducted at the University of Southern California. \n\nIn the experiment, subjects will be randomly assigned to work as a group or individually on a task where they may earn money. The task is an optimal stopping game. \n\nWe also wish to test whether group success  increases social capital. In other words, more than just working together, the group must achieve some substantive success to reinforce the benefits of group effort. As success may be endogenous to preexisting social capital, skill or other confounders, we  randomly assign the difficulty of the task. The task we assign to subjects involves a random sequence of numbers; some sequences make it easy to win, and others make it hard to win. Effectively, some groups are ``lucky'' and get an easy task, and other groups are ``unlucky'' and get a harder task. Thus our proxy for success, is difficulty of the task.\n\nThis variable is not as artificial as it might seem. The success of local  development projects depends not only on the skill and organisation of the participants - but also on their luck. Too much or too little rain can doom an otherwise promising project - or reward a not-so-good project. Changes in the global market for a product, say coffee, are also unpredictable and make outcomes stochastic. Similar arguments could be made about the role of violence, changes in politics and property rights, and many other variables. \n\nThe optimal stopping game involves making decisions about a sequence of numbers. The player(s) are  presented with one number at a time from a finite sequence. As each number is presented they must decide whether to stop or to continue drawing numbers (if they have not reached the end of the sequence). If they stop at the largest number, then they win.\n\nSome sequences are easy to win using intuition or using probability calculations. For example, if drawing from integers between 1 and 100, the sequence 1,2,3,4,5  is easy to win because at each step, the player knows that the next number must be higher; there are no lower numbers left to sample. Similarly, a sequence 100, 1, 2, 3, 4 is also easy to win; once the player sees the maximum of the population, obviously there are no higher numbers elsewhere in the sequence. Other sequences are very hard; for example, 24, 99, 4, 7, 100. The player will be tempted to choose 99, not knowing a larger number exists later in the sequence. Most sequences of course, fall between these two extremes. But effectively these sequences can be called ``easy'' or ``difficult'', and we can use them to predict success.\n\nWe  classify sequences as easy or difficult depending on whether a player would win using one of several strategies. If the player would win using any of the strategies, we call the game easy. If the player would lose using any of the strategies, we call the game difficult. The strategies are all probabilistic stopping rules. We calculate the probability of winning associated with stopping on some number versus continuing in the sequence. We then apply the following stopping rule:\n\nStop if P(win if stop now) $>$ P(win if continue) + c\n\t\nwhere we vary $c$ from -.15 to +.15. \n\nIf the player would win for any value of $c$ between -.2 and +.2, we call the game easy. If the player would lose for any value of $c$ between -.2 and +.2, we call the game difficult. We discard sequences where $-.15 < c < +.15$. Note that the optimal strategy is $c=0$, that is, one should stop if the probability of winning on the current round is greater than .50 to maximise the probability of winning from a random sequence.", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "id": "20141002AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "Hypotheses:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Group activity increases social capital.\n\nWe expect all measures of social capital to be higher for subjects in the group treatment than those in the individual treatment.  \n\n\\item  Assignment to an easy sequence of numbers in the optimal stopping game increases social capital compared with assignment to a difficult sequence of numbers in the optimal stopping game.\n\nWe expect subjects assigned to an easy task to report higher rates of social capital than those assigned to the individual treatment. \n\n\\item  Interaction of Group/Individual and Easy/Hard tasks\n\nWe expect subjects assigned to the combination of Group/Easy treatments to have the highest level of social capital, as success in their task should reinforce and make positive their group experience.

Specifically, because the US is more popular than China, we would expect that rejecting an offer from China would have a more positive effect than rejecting an offer from the US on individuals' attitudes toward their government and pride in being an Indian.", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "The Domestic Politics of Rejecting Aid: Evidence from India", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Carnegie, Dolan", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Researchers", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "Our main dependent variables are: opinions about the government's competence to respond to the disaster, opinions about the government's preparedness for the disaster, overall attitude toward India, and pride in being an Indian.

The current Ebola outbreak originated in rural Guinea, West Africa, in December 2013, though it was not officially declared by the World Health Organization until March 2014. As of October 29, 2014, more than 13,000 people have been infected and more than 4,900 have died (World Health Organization, 2014). In late September, the CDC confirmed the first travel-associated case of Ebola to be diagnosed in the United States and shortly thereafter two American health workers became infected in the course of treating that patient (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014). Since then, individual Americans, the media, and politicians have shifted their attention toward the origins and spread of the disease, and its implications for U.S. public health and immigration. Google trends, for example, illustrates an unprecedented spike in Google searches for Ebola since October. Meanwhile, politicians, particularly those competing in the upcoming U.S. midterm elections have called for travel bans from West African countries at the heart of the Ebola epidemic. Schools have been closed out of fear of the spread of the virus in Ohio and Texas, despite the extremely unlikely possibility of an American outbreak occurring.\n\nThis unfortunate crisis, and its timing, offers a unique research opportunity to capture American attitudes and behaviors in the midst of issue politicization. We propose to run a survey experiment that will capture the American public\u2019s response toward Ebola, immigration, and current government efforts at addressing a public health and national security crisis.

Over the last decade, fact\u00adchecking has begun to spread among professional news organizations in the US and overseas. Prominent fact\u00adchecking organizations such as FactCheck.org and PolitiFact have achieved high visibility and acceptance in the media world. Their work has won major journalism awards, including a Pulitzer Prize for PolitiFact; they have established partnerships with well\u00adknown outlets such as NPR, CNN, and USA Today; and they are cited and quoted heavily in print and broadcast media. As the genre has gained professional acceptance, it has become somewhat more common in elite political coverage and is seen as part of a trend toward more frequent accountability reporting.\n\nThis trend appears to be the result of a fairly rapid shift in attitudes among a growing cohort of national political journalists at the center of the profession. Fact\u00adchecking seems to be contagious. The relatively quick spread of fact\u00adchecking among elite news sources necessitates a better understanding of its causes, and of the factors which may drive its further adoption by individual journalists and/or news organizations.\n\nOne explanation for the spread of fact\u00adchecking is social influence through comparison to peers. Journalists and the news organizations they work for define professional success in relation to their peers and may prove sensitive to peer comparisons that highlight the embrace of fact\u00adchecking by standard\u00adbearers in the field. An alternative account is that the growth of fact\u00adchecking has been driven primarily by reader demand. Fact\u00adchecking has frequently been identified by practitioners as a genre that can potentially broaden the audience for political coverage. Established fact\u00adcheckers often cite traffic statistics to demonstrate rising interest in this form of journalism.\n\nThis study investigates these two competing accounts of the spread of fact-checking among professional journalists. We randomly assign political journalists to be sent emails and letters that use either supply\u00adside or demand\u00adside messages to promote the use of fact\u00adchecking. In the supply treatments (whose full text are included below), the messages note that prestigious journalists are doing fact\u00adchecking, present fact\u00adchecking as consistent with the highest ideals of journalism, and inform reporters that we will be monitoring coverage to look for the best examples of fact\u00adchecking. In the demand treatments (whose full texts are also included below), the messages assert that readers want fact\u00adchecking, present evidence of consumer enthusiasm for fact\u00adchecking content, and inform reporters that we will be monitoring coverage to see who is best meeting reader demand for fact\u00adchecking.", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "id": "20141103AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "We specifically propose to test three hypotheses about the effect of these messages on subsequent political coverage by the treated journalists and news outlets:\n\nHypothesis 1a: Journalists and media outlets that are assigned to receive the supply\u00ad-side treatment will be more likely to incorporate fact\u00adchecking into their political coverage than those that are not.\n\nHypothesis 1b: Journalists and media outlets that are assigned to receive the demand\u00ad-side treatment will be more likely to incorporate fact\u00adchecking into their political coverage than those that are not.\n\nHypothesis 2: The supply\u00ad-side treatment will generate more fact\u00adchecking coverage than the demand\u00ad-side treatment.\n\ufffc\nWe will also investigate the following research questions where we do not have clear a priori theoretical expectations. First, we are interested in testing whether outlets and journalists that already incorporate fact\u00adchecking into their coverage to some extent are more or less likely to engage in additional fact\u00adchecking when they receive a message promoting its use. This is not only an important statistical concern (heterogeneous treatment effects) but a question with substantively important implications for understanding how fact\u00adchecking spreads.\n\nResearch question 1: Are messages promoting greater use of fact\u00adchecking more or less effective among outlets who already fact\u00adcheck relatively frequently and the reporters who work at them?\n\n(Note: As we discuss below, outlets with dedicated fact\u00adchecking operations are excluded from our sample. As such, the research question investigates differences among media organizations that have not made a formal commitment to the approach.)\n\nA second research question we plan to investigate is whether fact\u00adchecking by geogprahically nearby outlets accelerates or hinders the spread of fact\u00adchecking. It is possible that reporters are more responsive to fact\u00adchecking when it is practiced by their journalistic peers in a given state, but an alternate hypothesis (described above) is that media outlets and the reporters they employ engage in product differentiation and would thus actually be less responsive when fact\u00adchecking is already in use nearby. We propose to test this research question using reporters and outlets in states where a PolitiFact affiliate or dedicated fact\u00adchecking project (e.g., the Truth in Numbers project at the Cleveland Plain Dealer) is in operation in 2014.\n\nResearch question 2: Are messages promoting greater use of fact\u00adchecking more or less effective among journalists and outlets in states in which an outlet has a dedicated fact\u00adchecking operation?\n\nFinally, we are interested in the effects of competitive political campaigns on fact\u00adchecking. One possibility is that the intense debate and reader interest generated by these races motivate media outlets to devote more resources to coverage, including fact\u00adchecking. In this sense, fact\u00adchecking might act as a complement to existing political coverage, which typically takes a more agnostic approach to factual claims and counter\u00adclaims between candidates. However, an alternate possibility is that fact\u00adchecking acts as a substitute for traditional forms of campaign coverage. When a campaign is less competitive or an important politician faces little opposition, fact\u00adchecking may help provide an alternate form of accountability for their public statements. Conversely, competitive campaigns might tax the resources of media outlets, which are forced to devote more coverage to traditional \"horse\u00adrace\" coverage of campaign events such as stump speeches, television advertisements, polls, and debates, leaving little capacity for fact\u00adchecking. We propose the following research question, which we will also evaluate:\n\nResearch question 3: Are messages promoting greater use of fact\u00adchecking more or less effective in states with competitive statewide campaigns?", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Why do journalists fact\u00adcheck?

Specifically, we utilize a multilevel randomization strategy to ensure that we obtain a valid estimate of the individual-level effects of our treatments (our primary outcomes of interest) as well as estimates of any potential intra-organizational spillovers within media outlets. Each outlet (newspaper) is assigned to one of five conditions: \n-Supply side (low): One half of the eligible journalists in that organization will be sent the supply-side treatment;\n-Supply side (high): All of the eligible journalists in that organization will be sent the supply-side treatment;\n-Demand side (low): One half of the eligible journalists in that organization will be sent the demand-side treatment;\n-Demand side (high): All of the eligible journalists in that organization will be sent the demand-side treatment;\n-Control: No reporters in that organization will receive either the supply-side or demand-side treatment.\n\nBy randomly varying the level of saturation of pro-factchecking messages within a given outlet, we can directly estimate whether and to what extent the treatments are affecting journalists in the control group within the outlet -- a possible complication in an experimental design of this type. Under certain assumptions, this design allows us to estimate whether there are intra-organizational spillovers in which reporters who were not assigned to treatment are influenced by its content through some form of contact with members of the treatment groups, whose prevalence will vary exogenously with the level of saturation.\n\n\nEligibility and exclusion criteria for participants\n\nOur sample at the outlet level comprises newspapers that meet the following conditions:\n\nA newspaper with a minimum circulation of 100,000 in 2007 that is still in operation and not online-only or free (excludes the Examiner [CA], Washington Examiner, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Rocky Mountain News, and am New York; the Honolulu Star-Advertiser is treated as the sum of the circulations of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin and Honolulu Advertiser). We used circulation in 2007 because it is prior to significant growth in fact-checking in the 2008 election and allows for the lag between changes in newspaper economics and newsroom staffing. Despite the downturn in newspaper circulation, the relative ordering of newspapers by circulation is highly consistent -- for instance, all of the top 50 newspapers by circulation in 2014 are in our sample (excluding those dropped based on the criteria listed below) and virtually all of the outlets in our sample remain among the top 100 daily or Sunday newspapers by circulation. (This criterion also allows us to ensure that our results are comparable with an ongoing retrospective study of fact-checking in previous elections, which used the same 2007 circulation data as part of the sample construction criteria.)\t\t\nThe newspaper must have full-text availability for content published during the study period in the LexisNexis Academic, Proquest, or Access World News databases (the news databases we use for this study, which cover almost all of the outlets selected using the first criterion).\nNames and email contact information for political reporting staff must be available for the outlet (necessary for randomization at the journalist level) and qualifying articles must be published by newspaper staff (all qualifying articles in the Press Enterprise were written by Orange County Register staff writers).\nAll outlets that were already affiliated with PolitiFact were excluded because they had already made an institutional commitment to fact-checking.\nThe New York Times was excluded because one of the PIs is affiliated with that outlet (Nyhan). It was also necessary to exclude the Wall Street Journal, an outlier in the number of qualifying reporters (these created balance problems for the multilevel randomization design).\n\nThe full list of 82 qualifying outlets is available upon request from the authors.\n\nAt the journalist level, our sample was drawn from the political reporting staff of outlets that meet the study inclusion criteria listed above. Eligible reporters were determined by compiling bylines on political news coverage in eligible outlets during June 2014 (6/1/14 to 6/30/14) using a standard political keyword search in Lexis Nexis, ProQuest, or Access World News as applicable. Specifically, the total number of political articles written by reporters was measured by searching for this list of political keywords during the June 1-30, 2014 period: \n\nelection OR presidential OR Senate OR Senator OR Sen. OR Congress OR Congressman OR Congresswoman OR Legislature OR Legislator OR \"House of Representatives\" OR \"State House\" OR Capitol OR \"state assembly\" OR \"general assembly\" OR \"legislative assembly\" OR assemblyman OR assemblywoman OR Democrat OR Republican OR Democratic OR DFL OR GOP OR governor OR Gov. OR Mayor OR constitution OR \"city council\" OR councilman OR councilwoman \n\nAuthors of three or more political news articles during the sample period were counted as political reporters for the purposes of the study (opinion columns, op-eds, and editorials were excluded; co-bylines were counted). The set of 1689 qualifying reporters in the sample is available upon request from the authors.\n\nMore specifically, we generated the list of political reporters for each outlet by applying following procedure to keyword search results and applying the coding rules below:\na. Research assistants (RAs) who were blind to the details and hypotheses of the study design performed the keyword search above with date range and outlet specified.\nb. RAs searched within results for the author with first staff byline. \nc. RAs recorded reporter first and last names and total articles returned for journalists who meet the coding rules below (if articles >= 3):\ni.  Double bylines (or more) were counted for each author.\nii.  All reporters in the sample had to be staff at their respective papers. Any reporter identified as NOT being affiliated with the given outlet was excluded. If they have an email address listed that corresponds to a different newspaper, they were also excluded even if not explicitly identified with that paper. \niii. Journalists whose byline identifies them as an editor were excluded.\niv. Journalists for whom >=25% of returned articles on first page appear to be opinion or >=50% of articles on the first page are calendars, compilations of event listings, obituaries, sports, TV listings, or the history of street names were excluded.\nv. Unattributed articles with the author\u2019s name in the headline and a colon count toward that author\u2019s total (e.g., \u201cDoug Bonjour: \u201c). If the authors are listed at the end of the article and the person in question is one of them, they should be counted toward the given journalist\u2019s total.\nvi. Authors for whom >=50% of articles are .gov URLs that are otherwise unrelated were excluded.\nvii. Authors who cames up for more than one affiliated paper were searched for in Google and were deleted for the paper where they were NOT on staff of. \nd. RAs repeated keyword search adding AND NOT byline(XXX)\ne. RAs searched within results - first author in new results with a valid staff (non-opinion or external) byline. RAs noted total articles returned again.\nf. RAs repeated keyword search adding AND NOT byline(XXX OR YYY) to exclude last two authors (and so forth). \ng. Steps a-f were repeated until the list of valid journalists at the outlet was complete. \nh. During the process of compiling the sample of reporters, the following notes or adjustments were made to the coding procedures:\nNOTE: For the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, \u201cDemocrat\u201d was omitted from the search terms because including \u201cDemocrat\u201d returned every article the paper published from 6/1-6/30. \nNOTE: For the Press-Register (CA), content frequently appeared in both the Press-Enterprise and the Orange County Register. We treated them as separate papers.\nNOTE: We excluded reporters whose email addresses were either (a) from the domain of a different newspaper (e.g., articles in Orlando Sentinel written by reporters with LA Times domain email addresses like name@latimes.com rather than name@orlandosentinel.com) or (b) are from the corporate parent and not the local paper (e.g., Orlando Sentinel articles written by reporters with email address of name@tribune.com rather than name@orlandosentinel.com). This rule did not exclude reporters who use a personal email address (e.g., name@earthlink.net).\n\n\nRandomization approach\n\nTo account for differences across different types of outlets, we utilize block randomization in a multilevel context. We block randomized at the outlet level within groups defined the presence of competitive statewide campaign for governor or U.S. Senate (those with at least one \u201ctossup\u201d or \u201clean D\u201d/\u201clean R\u201d race for those offices as classified by the Cook Political Report on September 15, 2014), maximizing balance in the number of qualifying reporters at the outlet. We then block randomized within each outlet at the reporter level according to the design described above while maximizing balance in the frequency of political coverage by reporters during the June 1-30, 2014 period. The use of a multilevel block randomized design ensures that our treatment and control groups are as balanced as possible on key covariates at both the outlet and journalist level. All randomizations were performed using the blockTools package for R with the default optimal greedy algorithm. \n\n\nData collection and blinding\n\nAll outcome data will be collected online using post-election searches of news coverage by research assistants in the electronic databases described above for the study period of September 22, 2014 (the day the first messages were sent) through Election Day (November 4, 2014). The research assistants will be blind to outlet and reporter treatment assignment and will follow the coding rules described below. \n\n\nInterventions and dates of administration\n\nDemand email 1 (9/22/14):\n\nDear [name],\n\nAn important trend is changing political reporting \u2013 what American Journalism Review called the \u201cfact-checking explosion\u201d that \u201cseeks to separate truth from fiction in political claims.\u201d\n\nReporters understand better than anyone how politicians stretch the truth on the campaign trail.

First, I will examine the validity of the mainland CCP-SCIAT samples in terms of demographic and attitudinal covariates, as they compare to the online population from the China Survey and my previous samples with COMR. The hope for this section is that the CCP-SCIAT sample confirms the standard finding in the literature, that citizens display high levels of explicit support for the CCP regime (Chen 2004; Chen & Dickson 2008; Chen, Zhong & Hillard 1997; Lewis-Beck, Tang & Martini 2014; Li 2004; Manion 2006; Shi 2000; Tang 2005; Truex 2014; Zhong, Chen & Scheb 1998). If this is not the case, that would undermine the motivation for the project. The core output from this section will be a figure or table that shows the distribution of explicit support measures in the sample as compared to other surveys. \n\nSecond, I will examine the distribution of the D-score (implicit.ccp) using a simple density plot, to see whether respondents in the mainland sample have positive or negative implicit attitudes towards the regime. The distribution of (implicit.ccp) in the Hong Kong will serve as a valuable referent point, as we know these citizens are generally less sympathetic to the CCP and have staged repeated large-scale protests. The Hong Kong survey will also ask participants whether they participated in the Occupy movement (occupy), allowing us to see gauge the distribution of implicit attitudes of this population relative to the mainland population. I will also conduct a simple validation of the CCP-SCIAT, investigating the simply bivariate correlation between mplicit.ccp} and occupy. \n\nThird, I will plot the implicit.ccp scores agains explicit regime support measures. This will allow us to see whether or not Chinese citizens' implicit attitudes track their explicit attitudes towards the CCP. If we observe a large number of respondents with positive explicit attitudes, but negative implicit attitudes, this would be indicative of preference falsification. It would also raise doubts of the validity of explicit measures. \n\nFourth, I will examine the determinants of implicit.ccp, revisiting some core findings from the literature on public opinion in China. \n\nHere, implicit.ccp is modeled as a function of a respondent's age, CCP membership, university education status, government employment status, gender, and ethnicity. The primary output from this section will be a coefficient plot, comparing the output from regressing implicit.ccp on these covariates compared to using explicit measures. \n\nFinally, I will examine the determinants of preference falsification. I will create an indicator variable pref.false that identifies any individuals that have positive explicit attitudes, but negative implicit attitudes towards the regime.

Without a knowledgeable public, representatives cannot be held accountable and overall government efficacy is diminished. This reasoning underpins the introduction of \u201cpersonal tax statements\u201d in the United Kingdom for fiscal year 2014-2015. The goal is clear: to make government more transparent, by providing individuals with detailed breakdowns of how, precisely, their tax money is being used. Proponents hope that the information sent to 20 million taxpayers will help them better understand, trust, and judge their government. \n\nWhile intuitive, the beneficial effect of such information on people\u2019s democratic attitudes and behavior has not been demonstrated. Citizens may lack confidence and interest in government for other reasons. Perhaps they are aware of its activities and have judged it to be under-performing; perhaps they are culturally predisposed to take a negative view of government, regardless of their informational levels; perhaps the complexity of modern governance challenges the cognitive capacity of many people. Put simply, the idea that providing information about government will produce significant attitudinal or behavioral changes, while alluring, has not been robustly empirically demonstrated. Indeed, scholars know very little about the actual effects of information about taxation on public attitudes toward government and compliance with government. It is even unclear if citizens will retain the new information about government that has been made available to them.  Given that these unresolved questions touch on the fundamental proposition of democracy\u2014that well-informed citizens can hold their representatives accountable\u2014gaining further insight into them is no trivial matter. \n\nThe distribution of the taxpayer statements offers a rare opportunity to study a real-world nationwide intervention about increasing government transparency in real-time.

In the pilot study conducted over the summer, treatment subjects in the top quintile of income became significantly less supportive of progressive taxation their counterparts in control. In short, this hypothesis holds that when the treatment and income are interacted, support for tax progressivity will diminish at the highest quintile. \n\nIn the same pilot study, subjects exposed to the treatment became significantly less willing to state they were planning to purchase a large consumer item, such as a refrigerator or television set. We expect the same in the field version. \n\nFinally, informing citizens about government spending is a central goal of the taxpayer statement effort.  While the existing literature cautions against expecting interventions like this to have a large impact on public knowledge, we do believe that the statements have the potential to nudge citizens toward a more accurate perception of government spending.

They were then told they would receive a follow-up survey six weeks later, when they would be asked fact-based questions about the content of their taxpayer statement. To encourage them to read the statement---to take the treatment---they were told that those who answered the factual questions about the statement correctly would be entered in a lottery for an iPad.

Gottfried et al. (2013), for instance, find that people who reported reading fact-checks were more likely to answer political knowledge questions correctly than people who do not read fact-checks even after controlling for other factors. However, this association may not be causal; politically knowledgeable people could be more likely to seek out fact-checks or to report reading them at higher rates. Experimental research (e.g., Nyhan and Reifler 2010, 2012) suggests that fact-checks may not always be successful in correcting myths about controversial issues and can sometimes strengthen misperceptions among the most vulnerable groups. Fact-checks could also inadvertently increase the familiarity of false claims, creating potential \u201cillusion of truth\u201d effects (Schwarz et al. 2007). \n\nSimilarly, little is known about how attitudes toward fact-checking change as a result of exposure to fact-checks. While audiences for fact-checking websites were once a small niche, they are growing increasingly large. But it is hard to assess the impact of exposure to fact-checking because of the self-selective nature of those who choose to read fact-checking. Some people likely consume fact-checking because their interest in politics leads them to more political content, but others may be directed selectively to attitude-consistent fact-checks via links and referrals to that people regularly encounter or their own tendency to choose pleasing content to read. It is also possible that many non-fact check readers have negative attitudes about fact-checking that are not captured by audience measures. We therefore examine what happens to fact-checking attitudes during a campaign by comparing respondents who were randomly exposed to a series of fact-checks with those who were not.  \n\nSpecifically, we conducted a multi-wave panel study examining how attitudes and beliefs related to fact-checking change during the 2014 election. Respondents were interviewed near the beginning of the fall general election campaign (September 2014) and then again at the conclusion of the campaign (November 2014). Between fielding these two waves, respondents were sent three \u201cmini-waves\u201d of an online survey in which they were randomly assigned to either a fact-checking content condition or a control condition. In each of three mini-waves, respondents were given either three political fact-checks or three recent press releases. To encourage reading the stimuli, respondents were asked a single factual question about each article or press release. To maximize the relevance of the stimulus, we included state-specific fact-checks for residents of states with active PolitiFact affiliates -- the respondents who would be most likely to find fact-checking content relevant to them in a midterm election year and to be familiar with the source of the content (the local media outlet serving as PolitiFact\u2019s partner -- for instance, the Richmond Times-Dispatch in Virginia). \n\nWe examine how the visibility of fact-checking and attitudes towards fact-checkers change over the course of a campaign. Respondents in Wave 1 were asked a series of diagnostic questions such as whether they have heard of fact-checkers, if they visit fact-checking websites, and how they feel about fact-checkers. In Wave 2, we repeated these questions to determine how answers changed during the campaign. We also asked a series of factual questions about controversial issues covered by the fact-checkers. By using a multi-wave study in which we re-interview the same people, we can assess over-time changes while holding key demographic and attitudinal variables constant, helping us assess the extent to which motivated reasoning - which is often at its peak before elections - turns people against fact-checking and the information that fact-checkers provide. \n\nThe second component of the survey was an embedded experiment in which some respondents in Wave 1 were randomly assigned to be sent fact-checking information during three mini-waves over the course of the fall campaign. The beliefs and attitudes of respondents who were randomly assigned to received fact-checks from PolitiFact will be compared with those Wave 1 respondents who received placebo content instead (non-political press releases), allowing us to obtain the first over-time causal estimate of the effect of exposure to fact-checks.", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "id": "20141223AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "Waves 1 and 2: Survey evidence (descriptive/observational estimates)\n\nInterest in and capacity to consume political news varies widely. We therefore expect that more sophisticated people and those with greater political interest and efficacy will be more interested in fact-checks and more likely to report reading them:\n\t\nH1: Interest in reading a hypothetical fact-check (wave 1) and self-reported fact-checking consumption (wave 2) will be highest among respondents with higher political knowledge, education, political interest, epistemic political efficacy, and general efficacy than among those with correspondingly lower levels of the trait in question. \n\nFact-checking has also become controversial as it has become more prominent within politics and political journalism. Given the greater frequency of belief in media bias among conservatives (Pew 2012), we expect that Republicans will have more negative perceptions of fact-checking, especially among those with high political knowledge.\n\nH2a: Republicans will express less favorable views toward fact-checkers and fact-checking than Democrats (including greater perceptions of liberal media bias).\n\nH2b: The favorability gap between Democrats and Republicans in their perceptions of fact-checkers and fact-checking will be greater among respondents with high political knowledge than those with less knowledge.\n\nFor each outcome variable that was measured in both waves, we will present estimates from wave 1 but also analyze whether the observed relationship between the outcome (e.g., attitudes towards fact-checking, interest in reading a hypothetical fact-check, etc.) and our independent variables (e.g., partisanship, political knowledge, political interest, etc.) differs significantly between waves 1 and 2. When there is a significant difference, we will present both sets of results and analyze the observed pattern of change. (The possible existence of patterns of change will be considered a research question given the lack of evidence on how attitudes toward fact-checking change during campaigns.)\n\nWave 2: Experimental estimates\n\nHow does randomized exposure to real world fact-checking content affect citizen attitudes towards fact-checking and knowledge about contested and controversial political claims? We list our hypotheses and research questions below.\n\nGiven the semantic complexity of fact-checks and the cognitive effort required to process them, we expect that the informational benefits of exposure to fact-checking will be concentrated among respondents with high levels of political knowledge, while others will find the content of the fact-checks difficult to parse:\n\nH3: We expect exposure to fact-checking content will increase knowledge of information in fact-checks among more sophisticated people (those with high levels of pre-existing political knowledge) but not among less sophisticated people (those with less political knowledge).\n\nH4: We expect partisans to be more likely to recall belief-consistent facts they were exposed to during fact-checking (Jerit and Barabas 2012), especially those with high political knowledge.\n\nWe are uncertain about whether exposure to fact-checking will widen existing disparities in favorability toward the format and list it as a research question. One possibility is that people\u2019s views of fact-checking will become more polarized as a result of exposure to so much fact-checking content, which could stimulate motivated reasoning (e.g., confirmation and disconfirmation bias). Under this scenario, people who have favorable views of fact-checking should come to like it even more; those who have unfavorable views it should like it even less. Alternatively, however, exposure might demystify the format or undermine objections, particularly among respondents who have had little exposure to it or expect a less balanced set of findings than what was presented. \n\nRQ1: Will exposure to fact-checking polarize people\u2019s views of the practice?\n\nA second research question is how fact-checking affects trust in politicians. Reading a number of articles about candidates and elected officials making misleading claims may cause people to feel less trust in politicians, especially for those who are already highly distrustful. There may also be reasons that trust could increase or at least not change in response to exposure to fact-checks, however. First, a number of stimulus articles state that the claims being made are accurate. Given how little trust Americans report in elected officials, the frequency of accurate statements may actually exceed some respondents\u2019 expectations. Also, observing public monitoring of candidates and elected officials may actually make people more trusting by increasing their sense that politicians are being held accountable for the accuracy of their statements. \n\nRQ2: Does fact-checking decrease trust in politicians? Will these effects be strongest among people who are already highly distrustful? \n\nFinally, we are uncertain how exposure to fact-checking will affect respondents\u2019 feelings of political efficacy. The fact-checks provide a great deal of specific information about political disputes. Receiving this information could make people feel like they are informed about politics and have the skills necessary to participate effectively in politics. Alternatively, however, presenting people with complex and or nuanced information about disputes they may have previously been unaware of could also make people feel less knowledgeable (either by not knowing about the dispute or by having difficulty understanding it). \n\nThese responses could also differ based on respondents\u2019 prior levels of political knowledge. One possibility is that fact-checking could help people with lower levels of knowledge make sense of politics and thus disproportionately increase their feelings of efficacy. It is also possible, though, that people with higher knowledge will be better able to decode the fact-checks they encounter and therefore more likely to feel an increased sense of political efficacy than people who struggle to make sense of the content. \n\nRQ3: How does fact-checking affect political efficacy?

While this project description is being written up post-election it is prior to the General Accountability Board releasing the November 2014 validated voting lists and prior to any analyses.\n\nThere are three separate experiments that were run during this election they are described below.\n\n#1) Impact of Clarification of Voter ID requirement for Fall, 2014 election.\n\nIn the run up to the fall election in Wisconsin there was considerable confusion concerning identification requirements for the Fall election. The legislature had passed a law requiring photo identification two years earlier, the Federal District Court had stayed implementation of that law, that decision was reversed at the Appellate Court level in early September, 2014.  The Appellate Court said the state should enforce the law; then after several weeks of sending out messages that identification would be required, just a few weeks before the election the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Appellate Court and reinstituted the stay, meaning no photo identification was required for the fall 2014 election.\n\nGiven the considerable back and forth over the status of photo identification it would be reasonable to expect that voters would be confused as to what was required to vote. I developed a letter providing a clear and unambiguous message that \u201cNo photo ID is required for the November 2014 election.\u201d The design is relatively simple with a control group receiving no message and the treatment group being split evenly between one group which received this letter from their local County Clerk and the other group which received effectively the same letter from the League of Women Voters.  This will allow us to test whether having the information that there is no need to have an ID is more effective if it comes from an official government official who is responsible for elections than if it comes from a non-governmental organization (the LWV).\n\nThe primary interest is simply to compare the treatment groups with a control group receiving no mailing. After investigating the bivariate relationship, multivariate tests will be run controlling for vote history, geography, and urbanization. \n\n#2) Gratitude\n\nPanagopoulos (2010, 2011) has found that gratitude, i.e. thanking people for taking the time out to vote can have a positive effect on voter turnout. I am replicating that study and extending it in a couple of ways. First, because there was a recall election two years into Scott Walker\u2019s term that means there were two gubernatorial elections in the past four years with Walker\u2019s name already on the ballot.  From the voter files from Northern Rock County and the portions of Dane County I used I took all voters who had voted in only one of the two gubernatorial elections and randomly divided them into a control group which received the \u201cno photo id\u201d message (only) and a second group that received \u201cno photo id and thank you for voting\u201d messages.  This treatment group was further subdivided into receiving the messages from the County Clerk or the League of Women Voters.\n\nThe primary interest is simply to compare the treatment groups receiving two messages (thank you plus no photo id) with the control group receiving the single message (no photo id required). After investigating the bivariate relationship, multivariate tests will be run controlling for vote history, geography, and urbanization. \n\n#3) Guaranteed Privacy\n\nGerber et al. have found that assuring individuals their vote is secret and that no one will ask who you are voting for leads to an increase in turnout among those who are registered but have failed to vote in the past.   We retest this in Rock County and Dane County.  We identify a set of voters who are registered but have failed to vote. These individuals are then divided into a control group which received the mailer only with information concerning the photo identification rules and a treatment group which received a mailer with the photo identification information and further information assuring their privacy when they vote.\n\nThe primary interest is simply to compare the treatment groups receiving two messages (your vote is private plus no photo id) with the control group receiving the single message (no photo id required). After investigating the bivariate relationship, multivariate tests will be run controlling for vote history, geography, and urbanization. \n\n\nTreatments:\n\nThe treatments are delivered in a letter sent out either from the local League of Women Voters (LWV of Dane County or LWV of Rock County) or the local County Clerk (County Clerk in Rock County or Dane County).\n\nWe specify in advance three treatment conditions: no photo Identification is needed, no photo identification is needed plus thank you for voting, no photo identification is needed plus your privacy is guaranteed.  The expectation is all of these will have an effect, but there will be an added effect for the Thank You message and for the population that has not voted previously there will be an added effect for the Privacy Guarantee.   \n\nNote there is no pure \u201cplacebo\u201d mailer.  Normally, I would include a mailer with just a standard civic duty message.  That was not done this time because of the interest of the County Clerks. Their help was much appreciated and this served a dual purpose as I was able to run a useful experiment and they were able to get out important information about the upcoming election.  They were particularly interested in getting out information on the recent switch in conditions caused by the \u201clast minute\u201d court decision.  I would have felt uncomfortable sending out a letter under their name that just generally urged voters to vote WITHOUT including the highly pertinent information that they were not required to bring a photo ID.  Therefore no placebo mailer was sent out and the no photo id mailer serves as the closest to a placebo mailer.\n\nRandomization Protocol.\n\nThe list of registered voters is received from the Government Accountability Board in Wisconsin.  I stripped out voters who have moved (NCOA listings) and those in housing with greater than 4 registered voters (a desire to avoid apartments with a transient population).  .\n\nFrom each address with more than 1 registered voter I randomly chose one individual to be in either the treatment or control group. No household could be represented more than once.  \n\nAfter the individual in each household was identified I stratified the sample according to voting propensity.  I did not over or under sample from the various strata, but rather randomly pulled the sample for the treatment groups insuring the sample included representative numbers of habitual, and episodic voters", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "id": "20141225AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "#1)  Voters who receive a letter informing them that no photo ID is required in November 2014 will vote at a higher rate than those who do not receive the letter.\n\n#2)  Those who receive the no photo ID message PLUS the Thank you for voting in the past will vote at a higher rate than those who receive no letter and those who receive the No Photo ID letter.\n\n#3)  For the sample of registered non-voters, those who receive the no photo ID message PLUS the \"your vote is private\" message will vote at a higher rate than  those who receive no letter and those who receive the No Photo ID letter.\n\n#4)  For all of the hypotheses listed above, we predict the notification from an NGO (League of Women Voters) will be just as effective as the notification from an official governmental source (County Clerk).", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "The Impact of Photo ID Notification", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Matland", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Researchers", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "As the experiment is presently set up we can simply compare the turnout rates across the treatment groups and compare them internally and with the control sample (difference of proportion tests).

For example, published results in our field, political science, are much more likely to report p  values just below the 0: 05 critical value than just above it (Gerber and Malhotra, 2008a). This could be due to publication practices or to researcher degrees of freedom that allow them to select models that produce significant results. There are discussions inside the discipline, and more broadly in social sciences, about whether the introduction of a registration system like that prevailing in medicine would mitigate these effects, especially effects associated with researcher degrees of freedom. The basic idea is that if researchers precommit to a particular specification then they have less scope to (deliberately or inadvertently) report disproportionately results from analyses that yield significant findings (see\nfor example Casey, Glennerster, and Miguel (2011); Humphreys, de la Sierra, and van der Windt (2013)).\n\nThough the arguments for registration are simple and strong, there is surprisingly little evidence that it makes any difference. Do registration requirements really change reporting norms and statistical practices? To contribute evidence to the debate, we seek to assess levels of bias before and after critical registration dates for journals that required and did not require registration. As such, this study aims to provide a systematic assessment of the impact of registration requirements on `critical value' publication bias. \n\nThe study faces two challenges however. We seek to understand the effects of registration on prospective experimental research yet our own analysis uses observational historical data. The fact that the data is observational makes it difficult to establish causal effects. We focus here on assessing whether patterns of published statistics are less indicative of bias after those journals adopted norms than before. Since the data is historical it is hard to pre-register our analysis in a credible way and to ensure that results we report are truly tests or are themselves shed results. These features generate interpretational difficulties for any results we  find.

Second and more crudely, we implement a `global' test that examines the proportion of all z -statistics that are on either side of z  = 3.29 (corresponding to p  = 0: 001) and assess whether this proportion is different before and after 2005.\n\nWe couple these approaches with an analysis of an expert survey that captures beliefs over the effects of registration.

In that study, I plan to use the most common method of inducing disfluency, which is giving participants text in a hard-to-read font. Before I can begin my larger study on politics, however, I will first conduct a shorter study at Dartmouth College to determine whether disfluency is effective online, as other studies have all been lab-based. It is important to verify that disfluency effects can be achieved online given concerns like participants zooming in on disfluent text or having short attention spans on phones and computers. Like Alter et al. (2007), I will test the effects of disfluency by giving participants the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT), a three-item measure of the ability to reject intuitive wrong answers and arrive at the correct response (Frederick, 2005). I will randomly assign participants to take the CRT in one of five fonts, one fluent and four disfluent, expanding on Alter et al.\u2019s one font in an effort to find the most effective way of inducing disfluency. This cannot be done on Mechanical Turk because its users are often familiar with the CRT, and knowing the answers would negate any experimental effects. The CRT has often been tested at universities, however, and there is no reason to believe that disfluency operates any differently for university students. While selective universities have been shown to yield higher average CRT scores than national samples, disfluency has a universal impact as it involves the visual and mental processing of information that occurs for everyone.\n\nWorks cited:\nAlter, Adam L., Daniel M.

Specifically, it considers the case of South Africa. Ferree (2011) has shown that the ruling ANC party has been able to maintain a \u201cframing\u201d power that persuades voters that the opposition DA is an exclusive (white) party. This moves attention away from purely \u201cexpressive\u201d racial voting and party performance and toward political strategies of persuasion. This experimental test varies both the race (black or white) and party (ANC or DA) of an authority figure in the game. In a diff-in-diff design, it then tests how the authority\u2019s directions, behavior, and persuasive \u201cframes\u201d affect citizen actions. It can therefore test whether the ANC retains the framing power that Ferree found in the first four South African elections (1994, 1999, 2004, and 2009), and whether this depends on the race of the authority. In other words, does the ANC\u2019s framing advantage disappear when the DA leader is black? The experimental design also allows for comparison of the framing effect to performance and to racial and partisan identity absent the frames. The results will therefore show whether the mechanism Ferree points to is still effective or not, and therefore whether the DA\u2019s strategy in the recent 2014 election campaign of shedding their party label has been successful.

These economic crises have also been associated with other serious problems, like the democratic deficit, terrorism, and conflict. Scholars and policy makers believe that stable governments in this region\u2014and certainly democratic ones\u2014will not arise unless there is substantial economic progress. This progress depends on the extent to which these countries can reform and globalize, that is, integrate their national economies into the much larger global economy. But will MENA publics and powerful domestic groups accept such changes? Any serious reform program must be attentive to public preferences.\nThis project focuses on the micro-foundations of the politics of globalization and economic reform in MENA.  It examines individual preferences toward globalization and economic reform. This project presents a novel analysis, using original data on public opinion from our own surveys and experiments, of the factors that condition support for and opposition to economic reform and globalization.

Intermediate levels of support for globalization are likely for those who work in the public sector or are unemployed.\n\n\nHypothesis 1c: Support for maintaining or increasing the government\u2019s role in the economy will be greatest among those most strongly opposed to globalization. And increases in globalization will further enhance their demands for government intervention. \n\nSociocultural and Political Models and Hypotheses:\nAs previously described, there are several non-economic factors that can also affect preferences for globalization. We group these socio-cultural factors into one set of hypotheses, examining four different aspects of them.  \n\n\nMuslim societies are also divided by debate over the role of religion in political and social life. (Ayoubi, 1995; Esposito, 1998). A look at current developments across the Middle East illustrates the extent of this secular/religious divide. One strand of this argument holds that those who espouse a strong commitment to Islam in politics are also those more worried that globalization might introduce anti-Islamic practices into their countries. \nHypothesis 2a: The greater an individual\u2019s level support for Islam in politics, the less likely they are to support globalization.\n\nFurthermore, some studies show that religion\u2014both overall religiosity and different religions themselves\u2014matters for public policy preferences.  Individuals\u2019 attitudes toward various public policies are affected by their religious beliefs. Most studies find that religiosity is linked to less support for a government role in redistribution and social protections (Roemer 1998; Hungerman 2005; Scheve and Stasavage 2006; Huber and Stanig 2011).  Further, in terms of globalization, as it relates to religion, Hays et al. (2005) show that religiosity negatively affects support for trade among individuals in a sample of advanced industrial countries. Our focus is MENA and Muslim nations in particular.  \n\nHypothesis 2c: The greater an individual\u2019s religiosity, the less likely they are to support globalization.\n\nOn the other hand, those who are more Islamist or more religious may not view the government as the best place to provide social welfare and they may prefer that non-state organizations, like charitable societies and mosques,  provide such compensation and welfare (Benthall and Bellion-Jourdan, 2003; Karshenas and Moghadam, 2006; Jawad, 2009; Jawad and Yakut-Cakar, 2010; Cammett and Issar, 2010). \u201cIn the MENA region, due to poor public administration capacity (OECD, 2010), the governance architecture of the welfare regimes is highly decentralized. Access to social services and distribution of welfare benefits depend, for the most part, on non-state religious actors\u201d (Cerami, 2013: 9). Thus, we test the following hypothesis as well:\n\nHypotheses 2d: Citizens who are more religious or Islamist will be less supportive of globalization and government intervention.\n\nCitizens of MENA hold some of the most inegalitarian attitudes toward women in the world. These attitudes may color views toward globalization as well. Citizens may be worried that globalization will lead to the transmission of ideas that may undermine the existing socio-cultural environment that favors a patriarchal order. These attitudes toward gender roles are shaped by intolerance (Fish, 2002; Inglehart and Norris, 2003; Jamal and Langohr, 2009). And these high levels of intolerance do not bode well for globalization (Diamond 1996, Huntington 1993). With rapid change, citizens hold more strongly to status quo beliefs and values, especially on gender roles (Mahmood, 2005; Deeb, 2006; Al-Ali, 2000; Jamal and Nooruddin, 2012). If globalization and trade bring in foreign values and promote rapid changes in society, they may be most feared by those with the most traditional values. \nHypothesis 2e: Citizens who held more traditional, inegalitarian attitudes toward gender equality are more likely to oppose globalization.\n\nOur survey contains a large number of questions that allow us to examine these hypotheses.", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Economic and Cultural Sources of Preferences for Globalization", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Jamal, Milner", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "One on One Consulting (Tunisia)", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "For the last 14 months, we have developed survey experiments that will allow us to examine the effects of economic and sociocultural factors on preferences toward globalization and economic reform. We build on existing household surveys in the region and differentiate individuals into formal vs informal occupations, skill levels, and specific employment sectors. Our instrument offers one of the most detailed and comprehensive measurements of employment patterns in MENA. \n\nSurvey data are useful to create a full picture of what a nationally representative sample thinks about globalization. Unfortunately, it can rarely tell us anything causal about what induces such preferences.  In order to obtain a causal understanding, we need to conduct experiments. In these, we seek to manipulate some feature of the independent variables discussed above and see if this changes preferences toward globalization and economic reform. We thus \u201ctreat\u201d a randomly drawn group with one manipulation of an independent variable and see if their responses to the globalization and government role questions differ from those of the control group who were not \u201ctreated.\u201d\n\nWe perform two experiments. Each will be administered to half the population in our sample (N=5000). In the first experiment we focus on trade and we manipulate the economic gains and losses from globalization by sector and skill level. Through our questions, we are able to identify each respondent\u2019s (or main income earner in their family\u2019s) sector of occupation.  We can then place them within one of four categories (import-competing, export-oriented, non-traded; public sector).  We ask a standard question to everyone about trade.  But for two groups we provide them with more info.  One group, our second control, gives them information on their sector of occupation and whether it is affected by trade and how it is.  Our experiments then treat a random set of individuals within each sector with information about the gains or losses they may experience from increasing trade depending on their position within the economy (import-competing, export-oriented, non-traded; public sector; high or low skill). To avoid deception, we rely on economic forecasts to inform our primes. We then ask whether the treated group responds in accordance with our economic models outlined above. If so, then we have more confirmation that individual material economic gains and losses cause support and opposition to globalization and economic reform among the public. \n\nOur second experiment frames globalization in different sociocultural and political ways to see if non-economic factors shape attitudes toward globalization and economic reform. In this experiment we tell each respondent that direct foreign investment has created many jobs. While we tell them this, a randomly selected group sees one of 6 pictures about the jobs created. Each picture has the same base setting: it features a call center staffed by young people, implying these are the fortunate ones getting the new jobs.  Each picture then has one thing that varies from this baseline. One picture has the flag of the major Islamist party, Ennahda,  one has all men in ordinary modern dress; one has all women in modern dress; one has women in traditional dress; and one has men in traditional dress. \n\nWe test whether priming people with various cultural and political symbols can affect their attitudes toward globalization. In line with hypotheses 2(a-e) above, we expect that those treated with these pictures will respond differently to our globalization and reform questions than those in our control group.\n\nIn particular we expect the following:\n\nH1: Secularists will oppose globalization if it is seen as benefiting Islamist and religious segments of the population; conversely Islamists and religious segments of the population will oppose globalization if it seen as benefiting secularists.\n\nH2: We expect that men in general will oppose globalization if it is seen as benefiting women. We expect this finding to be strongest among traditional, Islamist supporting and religious males.\n\n\n Again, this priming allows us to explore the causal aspects of how cultural factors affect support or opposition to globalization. In order to see if the shifts that might have behavioral consequences, we also ask respondents to sign a petition that will be delivered to the appropriate government agency in support for greater trade or direct foreign investment.\n\n\t\n\nExamples from the Experiments: \nTrade Experiment: Control #1 for the Export Group\nSome people have suggested placing new limits on foreign imports in order to protect Tunisian jobs.

We include mediating variables that will allow us to discern the causal mechanisms underlying our hypotheses. These mechanisms derive from both economic and non-economic theories of preferences. We focus on six: 1. Labor Market Position and Competition, 2. Tolerance (in-Group vs out-group and social identity theory), 3. Risk Propensity and Status Quo Bias; 4.

This represents a type of racial attitudes, usually an attitude held by white Americans toward Black Americans, that is \u201csymbolic\u201d in nature, meaning that it is socialized early in life and is consistent, stable, and dominates other attitudes.  This attitude is usually believed to have two components: a commitment to the traditional American work ethic and anti-Black affect.  Modern Racism is argued to have replaced older types of racism, often called \u201cold-fashioned racism\u201d, directed towards Blacks.  While old-fashioned racism expressed anti-black affect through support for stereotypes about biological inferiority, Modern Racism expresses anti-Black affect through a belief that Blacks violate norms of hard work.  \n\nModern Racism is often measured through a set of 4 to 8 standard questions.  The most common version comes from Henry and Sears (2000):\n\n1.   It\u2019s really a matter of some people not trying hard enough; if blacks would only try harder they could be just as well off as whites.        \n<1> Strongly agree\n<2> Somewhat agree\n<3> Somewhat disagree\n<4> Strongly disagree\n \n2.  Irish, Italian, Jewish and many other minorities overcame prejudice and worked their way up.  Blacks should do the same.\n<1> Strongly agree\n<2> Somewhat agree\n<3> Somewhat disagree\n<4> Strongly disagree\n \n3.  Some say that black leaders have been trying to push too fast.  Others feel that they haven\u2019t pushed fast enough.  What do you think?   \n<1> Trying to push very much too fast\n<2> Going too slowly\n<3> Moving at about the right speed\n \n4.  How much of the racial tension that exists in the United States today do you think blacks are responsible for creating?                       \n<1> All of it\n<2> Most\n<3> Some\n<4> Not much at all\n \n5.  How much discrimination against blacks do you feel there is in the United States today, limiting their chances to get ahead?\n<1> A lot\n<2> Some\n<3> Just a little\n<4> None at all\n \n6.  Generations of slavery and discrimination have created conditions that make it difficult for blacks to work their way out of the lower class. \n<1> Strongly agree\n<2> Somewhat agree\n<3> Somewhat disagree\n<4> Strongly disagree\n \n7.  Over the past few years, blacks have gotten less than they deserve.\n<1> Strongly agree\n<2> Somewhat agree  \n<3> Somewhat disagree\n<4> Strongly disagree\n \n8.  Over the past few years, blacks have gotten more economically than they deserve.\n<1> Strongly agree\n<2> Somewhat agree\n<3> Somewhat disagree\n<4> Strongly disagree\n  \nThe answers are usually scaled into a single question to measure underlying \u201cracial resentment\u201d.  \n\nModern Racism scales have been criticized for conflating \u201cracism\u201d with \u201cprincipled conservatism\u201d (Sniderman and Tetlock 1986) because conservatism could include the belief that individuals are responsible for their own position in life and that government should not intervene to remedy inequality between groups.  \n\nI propose to test whether the attitudes underlying Modern Racism are rooted in anti-black affect by testing whether respondents will agree with the standard racial resentment statements when the statements are made about groups other than Blacks.  I will do this by testing a subset of the questions (the four used by Tesler and Sears (2010)) and substituting other groups, in the place of \u201cBlacks\u201d into the same questions.  These groups are whites, \u201cother Americans\u201d, Hispanics, and a series of obscure nationality groups from various parts of the world, such as Nepalese.  So, for example, a question could read: \u201cIt\u2019s really a matter of some people not trying hard enough; if Nepalese would only try harder they could be just as well off as whites \u201c\n\nIf responses to these questions really do represent principled conservatism, and not anti-Black affect, then respondents should be equally likely to agree, regardless of which group is asked about. However, if subjects are equally likely to agree regardless of the group, there are two other possible reasons for this agreement that should also be explored.   One reason is a proclivity for \u201cJust World Belief\u201d (Lerner 1980), which is the need to believe that the world is fundamentally just and that people get what they deserve.  Another reason could be \u201cethnocentrism\u201d (Kinder and Kam 2009), which would say that white respondents should have a general tendency to attribute negative stereotypes to any outgroup.  I have weak priors about these three reasons that resentment could be the same across groups, so I will test all three.", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "id": "20150202AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "I will call responses to the standard racial resentment questions \u201canti-Black resentment\u201d and the responses to questions with other groups \u201cnon-standard resentment\u201d.\n  \nH1: Respondents will be equally likely to respond affirmatively to the anti-Black and non-standard resentment questions.  \n\nHpc: This tendency should be especially pronounced, i.e., the difference in anti-Black Resentment and non-Standard resentment should be smallest, among ideological conservatives and the tendency to express resentment towards any group should also be correlated with conservatism.\n\nHjw: This tendency should be especially pronounced, i.e., the difference in anti-Black Resentment and non-Standard resentment should be smallest among subjects with high just-world belief and the tendency to express resentment towards any group should also be correlated with just world belief. \n\nHec: This tendency should be especially pronounced, i.e., the difference in anti-Black Resentment and non-Standard resentment should be smallest among subjects with high ethnocentrism and the tendency to express resentment towards any group should also be correlated with ethnocentrism.", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "The Influence of Anti-Black Affect in Standard Racial Resentment", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Enos", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Researchers", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "Subjects will be recruited using Amazon Mechanical Turk, Harvard DLABSS, and TESS (pending acceptance).  Subjects will not be pre-screened, but analysis will be limited to white respondents in the United States.  They will be asked the standard symbolic racism questions and questions using a non-standard group.  The ordering of whether they see the standard or non-standard questions will be randomized.  This will allow for both a between subjects and a within subjects tests.    Responses to the standard symbolic racism questions will be scaled into a single score, which I will call \u201canti-Black resentment\u201d.  Response to questions using other groups besides Blacks will be scaled into a single score called \u201cnon-Standard resentment\u201d.    Questions about slavery do not make sense for the other groups, so subjects will only be asked the questions not pertaining to slavery when asked the non-standard questions.  When exposed to the standard questions, subjects will be randomly assigned to be asked all four questions or just the three non-slavery questions.  The non-standard group will be randomly assigned.   \n\nAfter answering the symbolic racism questions, subjects will also be administered the Just World Belief Scale, an ethnocentrism scale (Kinder and Kam 2009), questions about policy choices, and questions about the locations of certain countries on the globe. \n\nThe following tests will be performed using a T-test for a difference of means (where appropriate). \n\n1.\tDifference between average anti-Black resentment using three questions and four question standard symbolic racism questions.  This will be between subjects because each subject will only see one version.  The difference is expected to not be distinguishable from zero and this is necessary to provide legitimacy for the subsequent tests, which all involve tests comparing scales with only three questions.     If the difference is zero, all subsequent tests will pool the three and four question versions of the standard symbolic racism questions.\n\n2.\tDifference between average anti-Black resentment and each non-Standard resentment.  This will be tested between subject and within subject.  For the between subject test, subjects will be treated as being assigned to whichever condition they were exposed to first.  The within subjects difference should be smaller than the between subjects difference, however the within subjects difference may suffer from anchoring or social desirability effects, so the between subjects test should be treated as a more robust test.    Average anti-Black resentment will be compared to non-Standard resentment for each group separately (e.g., anti-Black resentment versus anti-Hispanic resentment, anti-Black resentment versus anti-Nepalese resentment, etc.).  Because each subject will only see one of many possible non-standard groups, the N for any particular group will be small.  I expect there to be no statistically significant difference between these responses.\n\n3.\tDifference between average response using Black questions and questions about all groups combined.  This will be tested between subject and within subject.  For the between subject test, subjects will be treated as being assigned to whichever condition they were exposed to first.  Resentment across all non-standard groups will be combined and tested against resentment for Blacks.  I expect there to be no statistically significant difference between anti-Black resentment and non-standard resentment.\n\n4.\tI will subset the respondents into self-reported liberals and conservatives and perform the same T-tests just described.  Because liberals may have greater social-desirability bias or a belief in social justice that is particularly attuned to the plight of Blacks, I believe they may have lower resentment towards Blacks than non-standard groups.  This will mean that the difference between anti-Black resentment and non-standard resentment will be greater for liberals than conservatives, with anti-Black resentment being lower than non-standard resentment for liberals.  I will repeat this test using non-self reports of ideology and instead using policy positions that do not include racialized policies. I expect these to follow the same pattern as with self-described ideology.  \n\n5.\tResentment and \u201cjust world belief\u201d.  The difference between Black resentment and non-standard resentment will be negatively correlated with \u201cJust World Belief\u201d.

In particular, we want to know if framing a policy as offering closely aligned costs and benefits will cause individuals to enroll in a policy more so than if the policy is framed as providing maximal individual benefits. We have partnered with Land of Lincoln Health, an Illinois healthcare insurance cooperative,that is federally funded as part of \"Obamacare,\" or the Affordable Care Act of 2010, to increase healthcare enrollment in the state. Land of Lincoln has distributed 10,000 mailers which we designed to to randomly selected Illinois residents. 5,000 of the mailers frame health insurance as providing aligned costs and benefits, while another 5,000 frame insurance as being in the best interest of the individual consumer. Land of Lincoln will make results available to us by the end of February, after the enrollment window has closed.\n\nThe general theory behind this experiment holds that citizens import norms from the consumer realm into the policy realm, and that the consumer fairness norm in particular can better explain policy uptake than self-interest frames. The design is indebted to Bertrand et al (2010), who examined the efficacy of advertising via a randomized mail design in South Africa. For that study, the authors partnered with a commercial lender. In this case, we will study the effects of advertising in a randomized experiment about public policy, in which we have partnered with a policy provider. Specifically, we are investigating whether consumer fairness frames that have been found to work in the consumer realm also affect policy uptake.\n\nWe are bringing the literature on consumer fairness, which has flourished in economics and social psychology, into political science. Consumer fairness is grounded in everyday consumer behavior which, with repetition, produces its own norms; the shared etymological origins of norms and normal are instructive in this regard. Scholarship has coalesced around a version of consumers fairness in which individuals expect the costs they pay to be roughly in line with the costs that firms bear, along with a profit margin that does not exceed the profits they perceive firms in similar contexts to be drawing. When consumers think fairness has not been achieved, they will penalize the unfair firm. Conversely, they are willing to pay higher prices when, contextually, they believe it is fair to do so.\n\nKahneman, Knetsch and Thaler (1986a) used survey data to show that concerns about fairness effectively prevented firms from maximizing profits. The vast majority of their respondents regarded a firm that would raise shovel prices after a snowstorm as engaging in unfair behavior; the same was true for a car dealership that raised prices for a particularly in demand yet hard-to-come-by automobile. One of their chief contributions was showing that consumers do not reflexively think of profit-making as unfair. In one vignette, survey respondents were told about a landlord whose rising costs forced him to raise the rent on a poor tenant, even though the increase might force the tenant to move. 75% of respondents found the action to be fair. Given certain conditions, consumers do not begrudge firms a profit motive. Respondents viewed salary cuts undertaken by a struggling company as fair, but unfair when undertaken by a profitable company. Ultimately, consumer fairness flows from a dual entitlement principle that binds both buyers and sellers. Buyers---consumers---are entitled to a purchase price roughly comparable to a ``reference transaction,\" or a transaction that recently occurred within both firm and customers' community or frame of reference. Sellers, meanwhile, are entitled to a profit within the limits of the reference transaction\" (Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler 1986a; Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler 1986b).\n\nEvidence abounds that consumer fairness matters outside the laboratory. Consumers weigh the fairness of a particular price when deciding whether to purchase it (Martins and Monroe 1994). When they feel that a vendor is not being fair, consumers are more likely to be dissatisfied with the good sold, if not outright angry (Oliver and Swann 1989a and b). They are also likely to tell other consumers about the perceived unfairness, leading to negative costs for the vendor (Zeelenberg and Pieters 2004). For their part, vendors are acutely aware of consumers' perceptions about unfairness. Examples testifying to vendors' concerns with fairness are all around us. Why, for example, do events such as concerts and sporting events sell out well before all the demand has been captured and reflected in higher possible prices (Okun 1981; Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler 1986a)? Why do popular restaurants not engage in ``dynamic pricing\" and charge extra for reservations during peak hours? In both cases, firms are willfully leaving excess demand---and thus profits---on the table. The likely explanation is that firms anticipate that such actions would generate accusations of unfairness, sowing the seeds of resentment and diminishing future profits. Indeed, recent experimental work has found that consumers do regard dynamic pricing as an unfair practice (Haws and Bearden 2006).

Along these lines, when conflicts between groups intensify, individuals are more likely to excuse or deny collective responsibility for their own group\u2019s past misdeeds (Roccas, Klar, and Liviatan 2006; Wohl and Branscombe 2008). \n\nThese disputes over historical wrongdoing can contribute to the persistence of intergroup conflicts (Bar-Tal 2000) \u2013 a pattern that has frequently been observed in contexts such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the former Yugoslavia, and Northern Ireland as well as relations between states such as Japan and South Korea. By contrast, acknowledging wrongdoing against the other side can contribute to reconciliation (e.g., Ginges et al. 2007; Vollhardt, Mazur, and Lemahieu 2014). \n\nIn many cases, denials of historical evidence in intergroup conflicts are paired with conspiracy theories attributing perceptions of an injustice to the power of the other group in the conflict. For instance, leaders in divided societies often promote conspiracy theories about the other side to try to achieve their own political goals (De Figueiredo and Weingast 1999). One reason these theories may resonate with ingroup members is the threat that conflict poses to people\u2019s feelings of control due to the occurrence of random or chaotic violence, minority group status, or power imbalances such as occupation. Previous research has shown that reduced perceptions of control can make people more prone to conspiracy theory beliefs (Whitson and Galinsky 2008; Sullivan, Landau, and Rothschild 2010). \n\nSpecifically, we investigate the factors that contribute to historical (mis)perceptions in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, one of the most intractable ongoing conflicts in the world. Our study considers an especially divisive historical misperception\u2014Jewish denial of the forced expulsion of Palestinians during the creation of the State of Israel in 1948. Palestinians refer to the expulsion as the \u201cNakba\u201d (Arabic for catastrophe), and commemorate it with protest marches. Most historians agree that Israeli soldiers expelled large numbers of Palestinians from their homes during the 1948 war and banned their return after the war. However, misperceptions about the Nakba or even denial of its veracity appear to be common among Jewish Israelis. In the most extreme version of the myth, Jewish forces played no role in the process; Palestinians are thought to have instead left their homes and villages on their own or at the direction of their leaders. Along the lines of the theory described above, feelings of a lack of control induced by the terrorist threat in Israel may contribute to Nakba denial and resistance. \n\nIn addition, the effects of information exposure and feelings of control are likely to vary by ideology. Vulnerability to misperceptions \u2013 and resistance to corrective information \u2013 are likely to be highest among conservative Jewish Israelis. Previous research has found that misperceptions are typically higher and corrections are often ineffective or even increase misperceptions among the most vulnerable ideological groups (e.g., Nyhan and Reifler 2010; Nyhan, Reifler, and Ubel 2013). \n\nBy contrast, non-conservative Jewish Israelis may be more vulnerable to the effects of a lack of control. First, perceptions of system instability and fears of threat and loss (Jost et al. 2003) are associated with conservatism, which may explain why liberals in the U.S. (Nail and McGregor 2009) and people exposed to the terrorist attacks (Bonanno and Jost 2006, Hersh 2013) moved in a conservative direction after 9/11. Similar results have been found using experimentally stimulated threats (Landau et al. 2004, Nail et al. 2009, Th\u00f3risd\u00f3ttir and Jost 2011; but see Greenberg et al. 1992, Kosloff et al. 2010). System justification theory explains this response as the result of a process of compensatory control \u2013 feelings of low control or uncertainty cause people to increase belief in the social and political status quo or reduce their support for change (Willer 2004, Kay et al. 2008, Banfield 2010, van der Toorn 20152, Whitson et al. 2015). These effects may be larger among ideologically moderate and left-leaning Israelis,  who are otherwise less likely to believe in nationalist myths about Israel\u2019s history and past behavior. \n\nTo test how feelings of control influence the persistence of misperceptions about the Nakba and the effectiveness of corrective historical information, we conduct an online survey experiment on 2,000 Jewish Israelis using the Midgam Project survey panel. We will randomly assign subjects to one of five conditions \u2013 either a pure control group or to one of four experimental groups in a 2x2 between-subjects design in which we independently manipulate level of control (low vs. high) and exposure to corrective information (Nakba denial vs. denial plus corrective information):\n\n1.\tPure control (no information)\n2.\tNakba denial; low control\n3.\tNakba denial + correction; low control\n4.\tNakba denial; high control\n5.\tNakba denial + correction; high control\n\nAfter the experimental manipulations, we will measure individual beliefs about the Nakba and Nakba denial (did the Nakba happen? what role did Jewish soldiers play in it? etc.) and also measure attitudes on other key issues related to the conflict (final status of settlements, Jerusalem, etc.) as well as more general views toward Israel and feelings toward Jewish Israelis, Arab Israelis, and Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. To measure how manipulating control and corrective information about Nakba influence a separate misperception involving Israeli military actions, we will also ask people\u2019s beliefs about the massacre of civilians at Sabra and Shatila. The massacre, which took place in Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon during the 1982 war, was carried out by Lebanese Christian militias with the help of the Israeli Defense Forces. A common misperception is that the Palestinians that were killed were terrorists and not civilians. Our survey experiment will be able to provide policymakers and scholars a better understanding for why these historical misperceptions persist, how they can be corrected, and whether they influence key attitudes toward the conflict and the peace process.", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "id": "20150310AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "We plan to test the following four experimental hypotheses.\n\nHypotheses:\n\nH1: Individuals in the correction conditions will report lower misperceptions than those who receive only misleading information about the Nakba.\n\nH2: Respondents in the low control condition will report greater misperceptions about the Nakba and less critical views of Israel\u2019s behavior than those in the high control condition. \n\nH3: The effect of misinformation on misperceptions will be moderated by level of control. Specifically, misperceptions will increase more in response to exposure to Nakba denial among respondents in the low control condition than among those in the high control condition (relative to pure controls). \n\nH4: Right-wing respondents will be more resistant to the effects of corrective information than non-conservatives. Specifically, the misperception-reducing effect of the correction will be greater among right-wing respondents than among other participants (relative to respondents in each group who are only exposed to Nakba denial). \n\nWe will plan to explore the following research questions, which raise important issues for which we do not have strong theoretical expectations:\n\nRQ1: Will the relationship between the effect of corrective information and ideology on misperceptions be moderated by level of control? It is possible, as we found in pilot data, that the difference in the effect of the correction between right-wing respondents and other respondents will vary by level of control. In particular, if other respondents\u2019 misperceptions increase more in response to Nakba denial when control is low, then the scope for negative correction effects is correspondingly larger. \n\nRQ2: Will exposure to corrective information change respondents\u2019 overall view of the extent to which Israel was founded in an ethical manner and acts in a manner consistent with its ideals? Respondents may, for instance, accept corrective information about the Nakba but interpret its implications in different ways (Gaines et al. 2007), causing their beliefs about Israel more generally not to change.\n\nRQ3: Do feelings of a lack of control or corrective information affect respondent beliefs about other misperceptions? A secondary outcome measure asks respondents whether Palestinian civilians (truth) or terrorists (misperception) were killed in the Sabra and Shatila massacre. Responses to this question will help us to disentangle the mechanism behind any level of control effect we find on our primary outcome measure. If Sabra/Shatila misperceptions increase in the low control conditions relative to high control conditions, then it would suggest that the control effect on misperceptions is not domain-specific. Alternatively, if Sabra/Shatila misperceptions do not change significantly, we would conclude that the level of control effect we observe relative to the control condition is conditional on the presence of information about Nakba denial. \n\nRQ4: An additional research question is whether corrective information about the Nakba influence attitudes towards Palestinians and Arab Israelis (Palestinian Citizens of Israel) as well as attitudes towards final status issues related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Scholars of intractable conflict would suggest that humanizing the outgroup by acknowledging their past victimization might make ingroup member view them more favorably and be more supportive of the peace process. \n\nRQ5: Past research suggests that those exposed to intergroup violence become more pro-ingroup, but little research considers whether this process extends to misperceptions about the outgroup.

These types are generically named \u201cH\u201d and \u201cY\u201d types.  Though we do not actually run the scantrons, we still need to convince the subjects that we are.  Instead of just having them wait, we decided to provide the subjects with a distraction task, which research has shown makes minimal groups assignments more impactful.  For our distraction task, we have participants try to find words in a wordsearch, and we do not provide them with a word list to make the task more difficult.  Once a plausible amount of time has passed, a research assistant comes in and tells participants that we have discovered their perceptual type and that they will be moved into another room for the next portion of the experiment.  This is where the treatment occurs.  Participants will be moved to a waiting room and informed about the next phase of the experiment, essentially that they will be filling out a survey.  After that, they will be informed that each participant will fill out a survey in a separate room on a laptop, and that they need to wait just a few minutes while the rooms are being prepared.  In the integrated condition participants will be randomly assigned to their seats in the waiting room.  In the segregated condition participants will be separated and will sit on the same side of the room as other members of their own group, but within each group they will still be randomly seated.  Participants will be able to see whether the groups are segregated or integrated as each minimal group will have a color-coded folder sitting in front of them.\n\nParticipants will then be given a map which also shows the locations of each participant ID number in individual rooms.  They will be moved to separate rooms to avoid monitoring effects and will fill out a survey on a laptop and some of them will participate in a resource allocation task.  In the resource allocation task, they are given ten dollars and told they can keep as much as they want or can share it by putting the money in envelopes marked separately for each of the groups.    After completing their survey on a laptop in their own room, subjects are paid and given a debriefing form that describes the deception involved and gives them information on how to contact the researchers for further information.  e collect three separate groups of measures: the participants\u2019 tendency to make negative attributions about both the ingroup and the outgroup; participants\u2019 tendency to perceive the ingroup as more similar to themselves; and participants\u2019 tendency to differentially attribute limited resources to the ingroup.  Each of these three measures will take precedence in 1/3 of the surveys.  In other words, in one third of the surveys the perception questions will go first, in one third the attributino questions will go first, and in one third the resource allocation task questions will go first.  While all subjects will see the attribution and perception questions, with random ordering, only one third of our sample will be exposed to the resource allocation task.   For each of these measures, we will test the responses of all subjects, but we will accept the answers of subjects that saw the measure first as most valid because that will eliminate concerns that answers are being anchored off their previous answers.\n\nFor each of the first two groups of measures, we collect several survey question answers.  Within each group, these will be scaled into factors and these factors will be tested for difference between conditions.  However, we will also report responses to each individual question.\n\nSurvey questions are included in the additional document provided with this registration.\n\nWe will subset our data in several ways and perform the same tests within each subset.\n\nFirst we will look at differences in responses between individuals sitting close to the outgroup and further from the outgroup.  In each condition, several members are assigned in such a way so as to be equidistant from both ingroup and outgroup members.  Subsetting to these individuals allows us to separate the effects of distance from segregation. We can also control for distance in regression inference.  \n\nSecond, as is common in minimal groups experiments, we will subset to individuals who indicate that they identify with the ingroup.  This is an important step in our condition because our quantity of interest is the difference between the integrated and segregated conditions and these conditions are meaningless outside of the assigned minimal groups.  We will do this by scaling several questions about ingroup identification into a single factor and splitting at the median so that we can test separately for high and low identifying individuals. \n\nBecause subjects are invited to arrive at certain times, some sessions may have more subjects than others. This may moderate the strength of the treatment because segregation may not be as obvious with only a small group of people as it is with a larger group of people.  We will look at session size as a moderating variable. \n\nFinally, we also intend to subset our data by gender and political party to see if our results hold differently for these different groups.  Since males have a greater tendency for stronger intergroup competition, we expect to see greater results for that group.  Additionally, theory suggests that strong partisans are more likely to have strong biases than weak partisans, so we want to test whether the results are moderated by partisanship.\n\nThe test of interest is a difference in differences test for outgroup responses minus ingroup responses for segregated minus integrated.  The outgroup-ingroup difference is expected to be higher in the integrated condition. This is a between-subjects test because each subject is only assigned to one condition.  Because answers may be anchored to the group they were asked about first, and outgroup and ingroup were randomized, we will also examine results without the difference in difference design, in other words, we will separately examine ingroup measures in integrated versus segregated and outgroup measures in integrated versus segregated.  Where appropriate, this will be tested using a T-test for a simple difference of means or a Wilcox-Mann-Whitney Test for non-normal distributions.

Vaccine skepticism tends to be geographically concentrated, leading some areas to fall below levels necessary for herd immunity and suffer outbreaks of previously contained diseases. Organizations have been actively trying to educate the public and correct misinformation about vaccines in an attempt to increase vaccination rates. \n\nUnfortunately, we know relatively little about how to effectively communicate about vaccines or the underlying factors that motivate vaccine skepticism. For instance, recent experimental research shows that common persuasive messages about the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine are ineffective and may even reduce intention to vaccinate among parents with the least favorable attitudes toward vaccines (Nyhan, Reifler, Richey, and Freed 2014). Similarly, a recent study of U.S. adults found that efforts to correct the myth that the influenza vaccine can give you the flu were similarly counterproductive among those with the strongest concerns about vaccine side effects (Nyhan and Reifler 2015). \n\nHowever, recent research suggests that vaccine skepticism might be motivated, in part, by disgust (Clifford and Wendell n.d.). The emotion of disgust serves as a behavioral immune system that helps protect us by motivating us to avoid situations, people, or objects that might cause illness. Many common disease vectors such as rodents, rotting food, and bodily fluids, elicit disgust and a corresponding aversive response. Another core trigger of disgust is breaking the skin via \u201c[e]nvelope violations\u201d such as gore or surgery, which also exposes the body to infection (Haidt, McCauley, Rozin 1994). Disgust is accordingly central to phobias regarding injections, needles, and related medical operations (Tolin, Lohr, Sawchuk, and Lee 1997; Sawchuk, Lohr, Tolin, Lee, and Kleinknecht 1997; Page 2003). \n\nThese findings suggest that disgust may contribute to vaccine skepticism, particulary among people who are dispositionally more sensitive to the emotion. Many vaccines involve breaking the skin barrier via injection, which is an \u201cenvelope violation\u201d that can trigger disgust, and a number of them produce an immune response by introducing weakened or dead viruses to the body, another potential disgust trigger.  \n\nWhile disgust reactions may be at least partly unavoidable given current vaccine technology, \npublic health messages about vaccines often include stimuli that could elicit disgust such as images of injections and children with rashes and detailed descriptions of disease symptoms. Messages that trigger disgust in these sorts of ways may actually increase vaccine skepticism, particularly for those who are more sensitive to disgust and/or are already skeptical of vaccines.", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "id": "20150323AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "Based on the discussion above, we expect that people who are more sensitive to disgust will be more skeptical of vaccination and less likely to state that they intend to vaccinate themselves and their family in the future.\n\nH1: Higher levels of disgust sensitivity will be associated with greater vaccine skepticism and weaker intentions to vaccinate.\n\nTo test the role of disgust in the efficacy of vaccine communications, we have designed two similar educational messages about how vaccines work that are described further below \u2013 one that relies on standard language and imagery (\u201chigh disgust\u201d message) and one that avoids language and imagery that might elicit disgust (\u201clow disgust\u201d message). We expect that a message about vaccines that contain potential disgust triggers will increase skepticism and reduce vaccination intent relative to one that minimizes such triggers.\n\nH2: People exposed to the high disgust message will report higher vaccine skepticism and reduced intention to vaccinate compared with those exposed to the low disgust message. \n\nWe are, however, agnostic about the main effects of each message relative to a control condition. Thus, we have two research questions:\n\nRQ1: Will exposure to the low disgust message change vaccine skepticism or intent to vaccinate compared with a control group?\n\nRQ2: Will exposure to the high disgust message change vaccine skepticism or intent to vaccinate compared with a control group?\n\nWe expect that the effect of the high disgust message on vaccine skepticism and intent to vaccinate (relative to the low disgust message) will vary depending on disgust sensitivity and prior vaccine skepticism:\n\nH3a: The high disgust message will be less effective relative to the low disgust message among those high in disgust sensitivity than among those low in disgust sensitivity.\n\nH3b: The high disgust message will be less effective relative to the low disgust message among those who are already vaccine skeptics than among those are not.\n\nWe are also agnostic about the marginal effect of each treatment on vaccine skepticism and intent to vaccinate relative to the control group across levels of disgust sensitivity and prior vaccine skepticism.

These items will again be averaged to create an index. (Don\u2019t know responses will be treated as missing due to the ambiguity of how to code \u201cDon\u2019t know\u201d on a scale of how disgusting something is. Averages for respondents with don\u2019t know responses will be taken across the remaining items. If the items do not scale together, we will follow the approach described above.)\n\nPathogen disgust sensitivity\nThe following items describe a number of experiences people might have.

After the unrelated questions, subjects will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: control, high disgust, or low disgust. \n\nIntroductory text\nNow we would like to ask some questions about a different topic.\n\nControl condition\n[No message]\n\nHigh disgust condition \nPlease carefully read the following article about how vaccines work. We will then ask you some questions about your beliefs and attitudes about the issue.\n\nVaccinations protect you from diseases that can make you very sick or even kill you. Vaccines work by stimulating our immune systems to produce antibodies (substances produced by the body to fight disease) without actually infecting us with the disease. Most vaccines contain a little bit of a disease germ that is weak or dead. Vaccines do NOT contain the type of germ that makes you sick. Having this little bit of the germ inside your body triggers the immune system to produce its own antibodies, as though the body has been infected with a disease.\n\n \n\nLow disgust condition \nPlease carefully read the following article about how vaccines work. We will then ask you some questions about your beliefs and attitudes about the issue.\n\nVaccinations protect you from diseases that can make you very sick or even kill you. They boost your body's natural defense system, which is called the immune system. Vaccines create immunity that protects you from infection without causing the disease itself. The way they do this is by helping your body to build antibodies that protect you from germs. Antibodies stay with you for a long time and remember how to fight off the disease if you encounter it in the future. By protecting yourself in this way, you can help keep your body healthy and free from disease.\n\n \n \n\nImmediately following the experiment, respondents will be asked a series of questions about their vaccine attitudes. \n\nWave 2 vaccine skepticism\nHow strongly do you agree or disagree with each of the following statements? [randomize order]\nVaccines strengthen the immune system.\nIt is better for children to get fewer vaccines at the same time.\nI am concerned that people\u2019s immune systems could be weakened by too many immunizations.\nIt is safer to get a vaccine than to develop immunity by getting sick. \nI am concerned about serious side effects of vaccines.\nThere is overwhelming evidence for the safety of vaccines. \nChildren get more shots than are good for them.  \n\u2022\tStrongly agree\n\u2022\tAgree\n\u2022\tNeither agree no disagree\n\u2022\tDisagree\n\u2022\tStrongly disagree\n\nThe Wave 2 vaccine skepticism scale will be operationalized as the mean response to the questions above (reversed items will be recoded so that higher values indicate greater vaccine skepticism). We will again estimate whether the items in the scale are highly correlated using via Cronbach\u2019s alpha or factor analysis.  If not, we will drop items from the combined scale and/or analyze responses to the items separately.\n\nIntent to vaccinate\nRegardless of what you did this flu season, how likely is it that you will get a vaccine for the seasonal flu during the next flu season (autumn 2015 - spring 2016)?\n\u2022\tExtremely likely\n\u2022\tVery likely\n\u2022\tSomewhat likely\n\u2022\tNot very likely\n\u2022\tNot at all likely\n\nHow likely is it that you would choose to receive recommended vaccines for yourself and your family in the future?\n\u2022\tExtremely likely\n\u2022\tVery likely\n\u2022\tSomewhat likely\n\u2022\tNot very likely\n\u2022\tNot at all likely\n\nResponses to these measures will be averaged to create a measure of intent to vaccinate if they are sufficiently intercorrelated (using factor analysis or Cronbach\u2019s alpha). If not, we will analyze the items separately.\n\nManipulation check \u2013 vaccination disgust\nWhen you think about getting vaccinated, how grossed out do you feel?\n\u2022\tNot grossed out at all\n\u2022\tNot too grossed out\n\u2022\tSomewhat grossed out\n\u2022\tVery grossed out\n\u2022\tExtremely grossed out\n\nNow I'd like to ask you about the good and bad points of getting vaccinated. \n\nIs there anything in particular about vaccines that might make you want to get yourself and your family vaccinated? \n\n[open-ends, ideally separate boxes 1-4 to make coding easier]\n\nIs there anything in particular about vaccines that might make you want to not get yourself or your family vaccinated?  \n\n[open-ends, ideally separate boxes 1-4 to make coding easier]\n\nAnalysis plan for the manipulation check\nWe will first test whether the messages had the expected effects on the manipulation check. Responses towards the measure of disgust towards vaccination will be predicted using an ordered probit model as a function of Wave 1 vaccine skepticism, dummy variables for the control and high disgust conditions (the low disgust condition is the excluded category), and disgust sensitivity. We expect that Wave 1 vaccine skepticism and the high disgust condition will predict higher levels of vaccine disgust relative to the low disgust condition. We are agnostic about whether the low disgust condition will predict higher levels of disgust relative to the control condition.\n\nVaccine Disgust = Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + Control Dummy + High Disgust Dummy + Disgust Sensitivity + [Constant]\n\nAnalysis plan for H1\nOur first hypothesis will be tested in three ways. First, wave 1 vaccine skepticism will be predicted as a function of disgust sensitivity and control variables using OLS with robust standard errors (the default model below unless otherwise specified). Second, wave 2 vaccine skepticism will be predicted using the same modeling approach among only respondents in the control condition. Third, intent to vaccinate will be predicted using the same modeling approach.\n\nWave 1 Vaccine Skepticism = Disgust Sensitivity + University attendance/graduate + Female + Age 45 or older + Black + [Constant]\nWave 2 Vaccine Skepticism [Control condition only] = Disgust Sensitivity + University attendance/graduate + Female + Age 45 or older + Black + [Constant]\nIntent to Vaccinate = Disgust Sensitivity + University attendance/graduate + Female + Age 45 or older + Black + [Constant]\n\nAnalysis plan for H2 and RQ1-2\nH2 will be tested with the three models below, which estimate the effect of the high disgust message relative to the excluded low disgust condition. RQ1 will be examined with the Control Dummy, while RQ2 will be examined with a Wald test between the Control Dummy and High Disgust Dummy.\n\nWave 2 vaccine skepticism = Control Dummy + High Disgust Dummy + Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + [Constant]\n\nIntent to vaccinate = Control Dummy + High Disgust Dummy + Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + [Constant]\n\nAnalysis plan for H3a\nH3a will be tested with a similar model that includes our disgust sensitivity measure and an interaction between disgust sensitivity and the high disgust message. The control condition will be excluded from analysis to clarify the relative effect of the high disgust condition, which will be compared to the excluded category in these models.\n\nWave 2 Vaccine Skepticism [Control Condition excluded] = High Disgust Dummy + Disgust Sensitivity + High Disgust Dummy X Disgust Sensitivity + Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + [Constant]\n\nIntent to Vaccinate [Control Condition excluded] = High Disgust Dummy + Disgust Sensitivity + High Disgust Dummy X Disgust Sensitivity + Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + [Constant]\n\nAnalysis plan for H3b\nH3b will be tested with a similar model to above except Disgust Sensitivity terms will be dropped and an interaction will be added between Wave 1 vaccine skepticism and the high disgust message indicator.

I have already explored disfluency in relation to the Cognitive Reflection Test, a three-item measure of the ability to reject intuitive wrong answers and arrive at the correct response (Frederick, 2005). When given the CRT on paper, participants in the disfluent condition received higher average scores, replicating the results of Alter et al. (2007).  Disfluency did not correspond with higher CRT scores when the test was given online \u2013 either with a university student sample or on SurveyMonkey \u2013 and led to lower scores among smartphone users. Therefore, I am conducting my political misinformation study on paper. \n\nThe sample is of approximately 300 Dartmouth College students. While the sample will most likely be more liberal and have a higher level of political knowledge than the country as a whole, disfluency affects everyone. It alters the visual and mental information processing that everyone must engage in and has been shown to have significant effects on university samples in the past (see, e.g., Swami et al. 2014). Participants were offered a $2 bill to complete the survey. \n\nThe survey asks participants to fill out a consent form and write down the time at which they begin. After asking basic questions about demographics and political affiliation, the experiment gives participants two short \u201carticles\u201d on political topic, which both look like real articles. The first is about President Obama\u2019s promise that, under the Affordable Care Act, \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep it.\u201d The second describes the comments of Representative Peter King, R-NY, about the Senate\u2019s recent CIA report on U.S. interrogation methods. King \u2013 a Republican and chairman of the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counterintelligence & Terrorism \u2013 says there were no lasting injuries from the interrogations. The articles\u2019 order is randomized.\n\nParticipants in the experimental conditions see a fact check after each article, which they are told is from a non-partisan organization. One fact check says that 4 million people lost their health care plans under the Affordable Care Act, while the other says that one person died and another lost an eye due to U.S. interrogation methods. Participants in the control condition do not see fact checks after the articles. \n\nAfter reading each article or article and fact check, all participants answer a series of DV questions. First is a Likert scale of how accurate they think Obama\u2019s/King\u2019s statement is, followed by a question asking how difficult they found it to arrive at this answer. Next is a free-response question on why they think the statement is accurate or inaccurate, followed by a yes-no question about whether they think Obama/King was being intentionally deceptive. They are then asked to recall a small detail from the article.\nAt the end of the survey, all participants are asked to name the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and the British Prime Minister. They are also asked whether they were already familiar with the experiment, and to record the time at which they finished the survey.\n\nWorks cited:\nAlter, Adam L., Daniel M.

from climate change mitigation across countries affects behavioral support for international financing of mitigation programs. In particular, we advance a theory of imperfect public goods, which posits that the perceived distribution of non-public benefits from a public good will have important effects on the willingness of individuals to support the provision of public goods. We test this theory in the context of support for international programs to mitigate climate change. From the perspective of economic efficiency and cost-effectiveness, the mitigation of climate change should be pursued where the largest reductions of emissions can be achieved at the lowest costs, since reductions anywhere in the world yield identical climate benefits. Additionally, the people who have an interest in providing climate change mitigation should generally prefer public solutions over private solutions to reduce free riding. We test when behavioral support for private and public funding of climate programs diverges from these expectations. In particular, we expect that subjects who are primed to consider the non-public benefits of climate programs will be less likely to support cost-effective programs in foreign countries. Such a result would demonstrate that preferences over the benefits of an imperfect public good have important effects on willingness to provide public goods. By implication, this result would also suggest a need to focus on the distribution of benefits of climate change mitigation programs at least as much as the more widely discussed distribution of costs.

However, this practice had significant cultural and historical meaning to Kenyans, and foreign attempts at eradication often led to violence (Anderson 2005). Notwithstanding this local resistance, Western feminists entered Kenya in the 1950s and created non-government organizations (NGOs) aimed at wiping out FGC. These Western efforts proved fruitless, and it was not until African women themselves began speaking up against this cultural tradition that Kenyans became receptive to anti-FGC\nNGOs, resulting in the gradual waning of this practice (World Health Organization).\n\nIs local support a necessary condition for the success of NGOs that aim to eradicate practices deemed acceptable to local cultures, but that violate what Westerners view as universal human rights? Specifically, will NGOs fighting sex trafficking in Thailand be more efficacious with greater local representation in the NGOs? Knowing how local communities will respond to foreign NGOs is vital given that much of the developing world relies on huge amounts of foreign aid funneled into development-focused NGOs or supra-national foreign agencies (Easterly 2006). In addition, given the gendered bias of sex trafficking, to what extent does this local support rely on the involvement of women in NGOs? This second point may be especially problematic in countries where patriarchy is strong.\n\nTo explore these questions, we will conduct an experiment in the northern Thailand this coming summer. Researchers in American politics have used experiments extensively to study how dimensions of identity, such as race and gender, affect perception of candidates and policy decisions (White 2007; Waismel-Manor & Stroud 2013).

What does the Roman Republic  have in common with the U.S. at the turn of the 20th? In all of these places, clientelism\u2014the exchange of money, goods, or in-kind benefits for votes between politicians and individual voters \u2014was an important and prominent way of winning votes. Just like Americans and Britons, however, Brazilians do not vote the way they used to. \nWhy do people who used to vote clientelistically stop voting on that basis? There is a tremendous amount of temporal and cross-sectional variation in the prevalence of clientelist voting and it largely reminds unexplained. The decline of clientelist voting is one of the more puzzling and persistent phenomena in the fields of democratization, political modernization, and political development, and it is my research question. I plan to use the Fulbright-Hays to gather qualitative data before, during, and after the 2016 mayoral and city council elections in Brazil so as to help answer this question in my dissertation. \nI am building a framework for analyzing and explaining the importance of clientelism as a determinant of vote choice. My primary unit of analysis is the individual voter and I use a multi-method approach with qualitative, cross-national survey,  and experimental  data. My argument is that increases in economic security lead to declines in clientelist voting, but only in the presence of certain systemic and individual-level factors that allow voters to easily identify non-clientelist candidates and distinguish them from one another. \nMost political science research on vote choice tends to be U.S.-centric and avoid even talking about clientelist voting, whereas the majority of clientelism research tends to overlook that it can coexist with other forms of voting.  I take a synthetic approach, operating under the belief that clientelism needs to be treated like\u2014and measured alongside\u2014other common determinants of vote choice, such as policy, retrospective judgment, and candidate personality. Clientelist voting\u2019s importance varies by country, voter, and election; it is one explanatory variable among many. My dissertation will provide an integrated framework within which I can estimate the importance of various determinants of vote choice at once. I will use this framework to explain why clientelist voting decreases when it does. \n\nTo answer this question, I will conduct a within-video-game experiment in which I embed virtual elections featuring clientelist and non-clientelist candidates within an immersive virtual world and manipulate in-game variables such as income to determine whether players experimental treatments of income\u2014impossible to do in the real world and impractical in a laboratory environment\u2014alone affect clientelist voting. I will also manipulate contextual variables such as numbers of candidates.\n\nI argue that increases in economic security are the main force behind declines in clientelist voting, not the sole determinant. Increases in economic security are not alone sufficient to cause declines in clientelist voting; they are only a necessary condition.\nWithout sufficient economic security, voters care primarily about basic goods. For those without money, food, or access to the state, providing them can win their votes. Other concerns, such as policy or candidate personality, tend to become ancillary when confronted with needs that are so immediate. Politicians see this opportunity, and if they can offer these things in exchange for votes, they do. When these basic needs are met, however, voters begin to want other things, such as self-expression, political participation, and the ability to influence policy. \n\nYet while I agree with extant research that a meaningful decrease in poverty is a necessary condition for a decline in clientelist voting, I deviate from it by claiming that decreases in poverty alone do not constitute a sufficient condition. This is because a decline in clientelist voting requires the presence of another factor: a viable alternative to clientelist politicians. Even if not particularly satisfied with a status quo of clientelist candidates, it is difficult for a voter to desire a non-clientelist candidate if such an option is not realistic. The demand side of the voting equation, in other words, is inextricably linked with the question of supply. \nSupply, in turn, depends upon a variety of factors at both the individual and the macro level. An individual voter must also the political knowledge and interest necessary to identify alternative candidates and distinguish them from one another. Some voters will have neither the willingness nor the capacity to carry out these functions even in elections with two candidates, whereas some (if not many) will be able to do so in races with thousands. \nThe macro level also matters because it helps determine how many candidates participate in each race. If one cannot compare the ideological positions, proposals, and personal characteristics of each candidate with one another, she will not deviate from a status quo of clientelist voting. This is a tougher test than it might appear. Electoral systems, for instance, matter because voters only have the willingness and ability to absorb a certain amount of information about political candidates.  There is a tangible difference between a voter\u2019s ability to understand the policy differences between two candidates and her ability to do so for a thousand.", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "id": "20150513AI", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Data collection has not yet commenced", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "H1: As an individual's income increases, her likelihood of voting clientelistically decreases.\n\nH2: As the number of candidates for an office decreases, the likelihood of an individual voter voting clientelistically decreases.\n\nH3: As an individual's income increases and the number of candidates for an office decreases, her likelihood of voting clientelistically decreases (interactive effect)", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Explaining Declines in Clientelism through a Virtual-World Experimental Design", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Lloyd", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Researchers", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "These hypotheses will be tested with data collected from my interactive game environment, in which I will hold elections between non-clientelist and clientelist candidates in which the user must vote.

While addressing the underlying causes of service unpredictability tends to be very costly (e.g., replacing leaky water pipes or increasing capacity to improve water pressure levels), low-cost informational interventions can potentially help households to cope with service unpredictability. Alleviating coping costs may also change the way in which citizens relate to their local governments.  \nThrough a cluster-randomized experiment in Bangalore, we will evaluate a text-message based notification scheme providing households with advance warning of the timing of water services and supply cancellations, and a dedicated contact number for reporting problems. We assess whether the notification system reduces: a) the time spent waiting for water; b) expenditures on substitutes for piped water services; and c) stress levels on account of uncertain and irregular deliveries and uncertainty.

We also examine if, and how, the receipt of real-time information changes how citizens \u201csee the state,\u201d whom they hold responsible for service quality and problems, and whom they approach about service concerns.

While other studies have sought to tease apart the expressive from the economic benefit of identity voting, this experiment focuses on precisely measuring a voter's willingness to make trade-offs between these different payoffs when choosing between two candidates, thereby measuring the voter's prioritization of expressive voting when other policy considerations are at stake. The experiment makes an additional contribution by measuring the emotional response of voting along or counter to identity lines both physiologically and according to survey self-reporting of emotions. This is a lab-in-the-field experiment that will take place in Vosloros Library in Soweto using 36 iPads.

Specifically, majority of voters will tend to vote for the candidate who shares their view on a public good distribution, regardless of identity, when this is the only policy being considered, but they will vote for the shared-identity candidate who backs views opposite to theirs with respect to the public good policy when there is also a private good on the line. Post-survey questions will show that this is due to an expectation of in-group favoritism.\n\nThe proportion of shared-identity members in a voter's constituency will affect voting along identity lines.

It is also now a key part of citizens\u2019 democratic expectations and rights, increasingly enforced by national and international legislation and legal rulings (Darch and Underwood 2010). Not only is transparency now viewed as desirable in and of itself, it is also expected to bring about a series of benefits, including greater accountability, increased trust and better decision-making while also acting as deterrent to corruption (Hazell et al 2010; Meijer 2014).  There are a growing number of transparency mechanisms available to governments to help public authorities reach an acceptable standard of information provision. These can be embedded within the formal frameworks governing how public authorities operate, such as the rules of disclosure on meeting minutes, or driven by the ethical stance of public officials or the more political wish to have their actions recorded for public debate and scrutiny.  Such ideas have influenced studies of accountability and responsiveness in a variety of settings (Ferraz and Finan 2011). \nRegulations include direct or general transparency mechanisms, such as registers of interests and Freedom of Information legislation (also known as Access to Information or Right to Information legislation), to more \u2018targeted\u2019 specific instruments such as lobbying transparency rules or technology-led experiments such as Open Data (Fung and Weil 2010). Mechanisms can be based on the principle of pro-active publication (of for example meeting minutes or spending) or reactive response to requests from users. Some transparency regulations combine both these features. In the UK, Freedom of Information (FOI) legislation sits alongside legislation regulating access to meetings, environmental information disclosure and now a broad array of online data published as part of the UK\u2019s Open Data initiative (Cabinet Office 2013). \nThis experiment aims to see if FOI requests can be used to stimulate pro-active publication and whether transparency leads, as supporters hope, to increased transparency or triggers resistance or inertia. We report the plan of an intervention that evaluates the impact of FOI requests on the smallest unit of local democracy in England, the local parish, compared to a \u2018everyday\u2019 non-legal information request and a control. We plan to observe whether an FOI request causes the parish to respond more frequently than a simple (non-legally binding) information request or ask. \nWe use an experimental design to test whether and to what extent local governments are more responsive to an FOI request than to a normal request of information by asking for information via an FOI request and an informal \u2018ask\u2019 . The experiment is conducted on a sample of 4400 parish councils, which will be subject to two measures. The first measure is a request for information for the organizational chart of the parish council and the second is a request for councillors\u2019 expenses. By asking authorities to go \u2018beyond\u2019 what is legally required and publish the information publically, we can also gain some insight into whether FOI can help lead to greater pro-active openness.

This question is important because most conflicts in the post-WWII era have been civil wars between competing sub-national, ethnic groups. Understanding the underlying causes and mechanisms of these competing processes is essential in finding solutions to ethnic conflict, while allowing for healthy expression of local identities.\n\nTheories on the development of nationalism identify several elements which constitute the nation: a common language of communication, a shared history (interpreted in terms of common ancestry), political unity (with heavy central dominance), religious homogeneity (controlled by a central, hierarchical structure), elites (who symbolize all peoples within the nation), and defined geographic boundaries (linked to a shared history). These elements were spurred on, this literature argues, by the rise of the centralized bureaucratic state (the military and education system in particular), print media, and modern mapping techniques, creating \"Imagined Communities\" of entire nations covering vast swaths of land. As a result, the nation state became the predominant form of socio-political organization the world over.\n\nYet, numerous observers have noted that nationalism is waning in many parts of the world. From Scottish, Catalonian, and Quebecois regionalism in Western democracies, to numerous regional rebellions in the former Soviet states (e.g. Chechnya in Russia, Crimea in Ukraine, Abkhazia in Georgia), to regionalized Islamic ethnic groups across Asia (e.g. Mindanao in the Philippines, Uyghur in China, Malays in Thailand), the decrease in nationalism's unifying force is a phenomenon that demands explanation.\n\nThis project seeks to understand why the influence of the various components of nationalism listed above are waning. Which elements seem to be particularly weak and why? Do local languages, elites, political organizations, shared histories, and forms of religious practice compete with their national counterparts? If so, under what conditions? \n\nThailand represents an important laboratory to explore this question as the balance between national and regional identities is currently in flux. Long painted as a homogenous Thai nation, these portraits masked significant regional variation in dialect/language, cultural practices, and pre-modern, historical political arrangements. In the past decade, these regional identities have become increasingly salient, as the North and North East voted together in democratic elections against the Central and Southern regions. Coups and mass protests have further intensified these divides, and last March groups advocating separatism emerged. The first phase of this project is being undertaken in the Northern region, centered around its historic capital of Chiang Mai. The North has a long history of political separation, having been an independent kingdom (Lanna) and/or under the influence of the neighboring Burmese for centuries before the unified Siamese state formed. The Northern dialect is much closer to the language of neighboring Laos than to Central Thai spoken in Bangkok and used in schools.

Participants should act the same regardless of anonymity.\nH2b: When national identity is stronger, participants will exhibit more prejudice toward Thai nationals of other ethnicities and religions. This will especially be so when primed by Buddhism and the Thai language. National identity, then, will act like an ethnic identity. Thus, anonymity of the participant will change behavior.\nH2c: When regional identity is stronger, it will act more like an ethnic identity, exhibited not only in more prejudice against non-Northerners, but also in differential behavior when anonymous.\nH2d: When national identity is stronger, the effect of crosscutting cleavages will also be stronger.

Asking respondents to react to vignettes that provide information about hypothetical mayors, we find that corruption is consistently punished, even when politicians are described as high-performing. In addition, we have shown that citizens react more strongly to information that comes from credible sources (defined as those that lack incentives to dissemble with regard to a given piece of information). This differentiation between more and less credible sources is particularly concentrated among political sophisticates (a concept that we have operationalized using measures of education, political knowledge, and political interest).\n\nIn the present study, we will use a module of questions on the Argentina Panel Election Study to (1) explore the extent to which our results from Brazil can be replicated in Argentina; (2) test hypotheses about how partisanship may moderate citizen reactions to different kinds of information sources; and (3) test hypotheses about how priming respondents about overall levels of corruption, to bring to mind impressions of the overall candidate pool, may moderate responses to corruption information in a referendum-style voting question. \n\nIn addition, we will use the survey to explore the concept of political sophistication in two ways. First, we develop a new survey experimental vignette where information about a non-political behavior (a possible foul in a soccer game) is delivered by either a more or less credible source. This vignette parallels our main experimental vignette about mayoral corruption in the use of information sources of variable credibility. Using a parallel vignette structure for a non-political behavior will allow us to examine whether politically sophisticated respondents (who we have shown in previous work are more discerning about the credibility of political information sources) also discern more between information sources in a non-political context. Second, we will include two new strategic thinking questions (one original to this survey) and use these to test for heterogeneous treatment effects in both the corruption vignette and the soccer vignettes across respondents who are identified as more and less sophisticated by these questions. That is, in addition to operationalizing political sophistication through measures of political knowledge, educational attainment, and/or self-expressed political interest, we will also examine whether respondents who show evidence of strategic thinking are more likely to differentiate between credible and less credible information sources in both political and non-political settings.\n", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "id": "20150603AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "For our main experiment on corruption, we will employ two main outcome variables: the respondent\u2019s reported vote intention for the hypothetical mayor named in the vignette, and the respondent\u2019s reported belief that the hypothetical mayor is corrupt. Unless noted otherwise (see H6-H8), our hypotheses expect a consistent effect on both measures (that is, where we expect greater respondent \u201cdisapproval\u201d of a mayor, we mean both that respondents should report being less likely to vote for the mayor and more likely to say he is corrupt). We treat vote intention as our main outcome of interest through most of this project, with one exception: when making comparisons to the non-political vignette that manipulates source credibility, we use respondent assessment of mayoral corruption as our dependent variable.\n\nH1 (Credible Information): Respondents who hear about mayoral corruption from a credible source will express greater disapproval of an incumbent mayor than those who hear about corruption from a less credible source.\n\nH2 (Conditional Effects by Sophistication): Compared to less sophisticated respondents, we expect more sophisticated respondents to exhibit greater differentiation between credible and less-credible information sources. Compared to other respondents, we expect more sophisticated respondents to be less punitive of mayors accused of corruption by less credible sources and to be relatively more punitive of mayors accused by credible sources. \n\nH3 (Conditional Effects by Copartisanship): Respondents who share a partisan identity with a mayor or an opposition party described in a vignette will react differently from non-copartisans in a number of ways that will dampen the effects described thus far. We expect respondents to heavily discount accusations of corruption, regardless of credibility, when they are made against a copartisan mayor. We also expect copartisans of an opposition party named in a vignette to give more credence to those accusations than other respondents.\n\nH4 (Conditioning Effect of Copartisanship on Political Sophistication Effects): The large amount of differentiation between more and less credible information sources that we expect to see among political sophisticates will diminish in the face of shared copartisanship with the mayor accused of corruption. Thus, among copartisans, we expect to see very little difference in the \u201cdiscernment\u201d exhibited by more and less sophisticated respondents. Or put differently, among political sophisticates, copartisans should show much less evidence of discernment between sources based on credibility as opposed to non-copartisans.\n\nH5 (Perceptions of Candidate Pool): When asked to characterize the quality of politicians in Argentina (a priming question half the sample will receive), most respondents will report that politicians are typically corrupt (highest 2 categories on a 4-point scale).\n\nH6 (Effects of Priming on Perceptions of Mayoral Corruption): Given H6, receiving the priming question should change respondents\u2019 perceptions of the likelihood the hypothetical mayor is corrupt. As compared to respondents who were not primed, primed respondents should be more likely to report that the described mayor is corrupt. This should be true for all experimental groups (control, credible accusations, and less credible accusations). As opposed to non-primed respondents, those who receive the prime should also give more homogenous responses to the question of the mayor\u2019s corruption when comparing responses between the control group (no information about corruption) and the treatment groups. We also expect less differentiation between the more and less credible information treatments for those respondents who were primed. \n\nH7 (Effects of Priming on Vote Intention): While priming will heighten beliefs that the mayor is corrupt, it will also increase beliefs that any opponent is corrupt. For that reason, within every possible vignette, we expect respondents in the primed group to be more likely to report that they would vote for the mayor as compared to respondents in the non-primed group. This difference should be greatest in the control vignettes, where the mayor does not face accusations about corruption.\n\nH8 (Effects of Political Sophistication on Reactions to the Prime): Since we expect sophisticated respondents to draw on their existing perceptions about the candidate pool even in the absence of a prime, we expect the prime to have less effect on opinions about the incumbent mayor among this group. This should be true for both assessments of the likelihood that the mayor is corrupt and for vote intention.\n\nH9 (Correlates of Strategic Thinking): Correct responses to our strategic thinking questions will correlate with traditional indicators of political sophistication (i.e., education, political knowledge, and political interest).\n\nH10 (Effects of Strategic Thinking): Conditional treatment effects among strategic thinkers will be in the same direction as those observed among political sophisticates defined using the traditional variables but will be larger in magnitude.\n\nH11 (Credible Information in Political and Non-Political Arenas): Groups that differentiate more between credible and less-credible information in the political arena will also do so in a non-political arena.\n", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Information Credibility and Political Sophistication: New Measures and Survey Experimental Evidence from Argentina", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Weitz-Shapiro, Winters", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "MORI Argentina as part of the Argentina Panel Election Study coordinated by Noam Lupu (University of Wisconsin)", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "The main survey experiment on information credibility and reactions to political corruption takes the form of a 3X4 factorial design.

There are multiple factors that affect voters' electoral behavior, but these can be aggregated in two main categories (Adams et al. 2005, Calvo and Murillo 2015). The first relies on the role of ideology, and assumes that voters and parties locate themselves along an ideal point on some ideological continuum. Voters prefer the candidate/party that minimizes ideological distance. The second category emphasizes the existence of non-ideological considerations in voters' decision making. This may involve voters taking into account some non-policy-related factors when they are deciding to vote for a particular candidate, such as descriptive representation (e.g. race, gender or social class), targeted distribution (e.g. vote-buying or patronage) and retrospective voting (reward/punish the incumbent when economic condition improve/worsen), among other non-programmatic variables. Adams et al. (2015) attempt to reconcile both groups of arguments by proposing a unified model of voting behavior, which integrates the behavioralist's perspective into the spatial-modeling framework. Therefore, the combination of the programmatic and non-programmatic components will explain voters' electoral decisions. \n\nHowever, all the theories that unified the spatial and sociological explanations assume that voters have fixed preferences regardless of the social and economic context. Ideology will have the same importance for voter i when she votes during adverse conditions (e.g. natural disaster or an economic crisis) and normal times. This project challenges this view, arguing that the importance of the ideological and non-ideological determinants of the vote are conditional to the context. Simply put, adverse conditions produced by natural disasters will affect the role of the ideological and non-ideological factors that explain voters' political preferences. Natural disasters are events triggered by natural hazards, and can generate significant costs for the countries and citizens affected. A natural disaster will modify voters' priorities and concerns.

The main goal of the conjoint analysis (Hainmueller et al. 2014) is to determine how people value different attributes of the candidates to make electoral decisions. \n\nThe experiment will ask a population of citizens living in the city of Copiapo to decide between two (non-real) candidates that will be competing for the position of mayor in the 2016 local elections. The respondents will see information about six attributes of these two candidates: ideology, gender, previous political experience, profession, age and proposal for affected citizens (proxy of distribution). These attributes will be randomly chosen to generate the candidates profiles. This experimental design allows for the comparison of the explanatory power of different treatments (Hainmueller and Hopkins 2014). In summary, the conjoint experiment will randomize candidates characteristics, which will allow me to identify the effects of each of these attributes.\n\nThe respondents need to choose one of the two candidates. The outcome will be the answer to the following question: if you have to vote for one of these two candidates, whom do you prefer for mayor? Each of the respondents will have to evaluate 8 pairs of profiles. Therefore, in the analysis it will be necessary to cluster the standard errors by respondent. \n\nThis particular empirical design will allow me to study the interactions between candidates attributes and respondents' characteristics.

I will conduct a survey and the conjoint experiment. The survey should provide extra evidence about the role of ideology and distribution after a natural disaster. I plan to conduct between 80 and 150 interviews.

Even more, we know very little about what is behind this political behavior or, to put it differently, which factors lead a citizen to vote strategically. On the other side, there is an important discussion related to the influence of electoral polls on voting behavior. In several Latin American countries, pre election polls are considered extremely influential on voters\u2019 decisions, and politicians promote their regulation in order to minimize that influence. However, it\u2019s uncertain how this influence works. When does strategic voting increase? Taking this background into consideration, the primary goal of this experiment is to determine if polling results showing different outcomes generate a strategic voting. \n\nIn Uruguayan local elections, political parties can compete with more than one candidate, and the winner is the candidate that gets more votes in the most voted party. In the 2015 local election in Montevideo there are two main political parties: one center-left party Frente Amplio, and one center-right party named Partido de la Concertaci\u00f3n (an electoral alliance between the two traditional parties: Partido Nacional and Partido Colorado). Since the beginning of the political campaign, polls predicted that Frente Amplio would be the winner with a difference of around 20 percent points from Concertaci\u00f3n. This prevalence endured the whole campaign. In the Frente Amplio the competition was among three candidates. Two of them, Daniel Mart\u00ednez and Lucia Topolanski shared the 99% of the Frente Amplio\u2019s preferences. Daniel Mart\u00ednez is a moderate candidate while Luc\u00eda Topolanski is a more extreme one, placed to the left of Mart\u00ednez. \n\nTherefore, voters whose first preference was voting for Concertaci\u00f3n were inclined to change their vote for their second preference (Mart\u00ednez, the most moderate inside the Frente Amplio\u2019s offer) in order to avoid Topolanski\u2019s victory. \n\nA survey experiment was applied on a sample of 504 respondents living in Montevideo, the capital city of Uruguay. The survey is a pre electoral survey carried out by Opci\u00f3n Consultores, a Uruguayan polling firm, during the week before election day. \n\nRespondents should answer the following voting preference question: \u201cIf departamental elections to chose the Major of Montevideo would be next Sunday, and the candidates would be the following: from the Frente Amplio - Daniel Mart\u00ednez , Luc\u00eda Topolansky and Virginia Cardozo; from the Partido de la Concertaci\u00f3n - \u00c1lvaro Garc\u00e9, Ricardo Rachetti and Edgardo Novick; from the Partido Independiente - Ivan Posada and from Unidad Popular Gustavo L\u00f3pez, for which candidate would you vote? \n\nAt the end of the survey, respondents would be randomly asked one of the following two questions:\n\n1) If one week before the departmental election, polls say that the Frente Amplio would win the election in Montevideo and show a tie between Luc\u00eda Topolansky and Daniel Mart\u00ednez, for which candidate from the pool of all political parties would you vote for Major in Montevideo?\n\n2) If one week before the departmental election, polls say that the Frente Amplio would win the election in Montevideo and show that Daniel Mart\u00ednez would win the election without any doubt, for which candidate from the pool of all political parties would you vote for Major in Montevideo?\n", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "id": "20150605AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "H1: Voters that receive polling information that the election would be highly competitive will show a strategic behavior. \n\nH2: Voters that receive polling information that in the election would be a clear winner will not show a strategic behavior.\n", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Survey information and Strategic Voting", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Pi\u00f1eiro, Queirolo", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Opci\u00f3n Consultores", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "We will perform a comparison between the vote intention percentage for Mart\u00ednez in the competitive scenario with the vote intention percentage for Mart\u00ednez obtained in the non competitive situation where he has already an important advantage over his competitor.

The emergence of these actors, though, is rarely endogenized in theories of clientelism. How do brokers build the following of voters that make them attractive to political parties? What characteristics separate them from other residents in their neighborhoods? \n\nThis study focuses on a pervasive type of broker in urban India\u2014informal slum leaders. We seek to investigate the origins of hierarchy in clientelistic spaces, and study the processes through which informal leaders emerge within proliferating slums. Based on extensive prior fieldwork, we identity five attributes that influence assessments over aspiring slum leaders\u2014(1) education; (2) caste and religion; (3) party affiliation; (4) region of origin; and (5) occupation. Drawing on a conjoint survey experiment design, we seek to illuminate relative preferences for these characteristics in the construction of settlement leadership. Two fictitious candidates for the position of slum president (basti adyaksh) will be presented to survey respondents. Respondents will be asked to choose the leader they prefer for a settlement \u201clike their own.\u201d The specific elements of the five attributes will randomly vary across the two candidates, affording the co-investigators leverage over identifying the effects of each of the attributes.\n\nWe also seek to capture preferences for who moves into the settlement\u2014what types of people do respondents prefer to be their neighbor? This will allow us to directly compare preferences for informal leaders (vertical considerations) versus everyday residents (horizontal considerations). A conjoint experiment will be administered to respondents in which they are asked which of two hypothetical individuals they would prefer as neighbors. The same attributes presented in the leader experiment will be randomly assigned to the two individuals. The order of the two experiments will be randomly assigned to avoid priming due to question ordering.\n\nA related and final experimental question will examine social identity salience as an outcome variable. India\u2019s urban slums are dramatically diverse spaces along the lines of caste, religion, and region of origin. Dense living conditions and pervasive vulnerabilities compel residents to look toward others to help mitigate risk and collectively act to advance their common interests. In the socially novel context of urban slums, why do some identities become politically salient while others lie dormant? Under what conditions do the fault-lines of activated identities change, particularly in response to the vulnerabilities that slum dwellers face on a daily basis? In particular, do the different types of goods slum residents seek from their governments activate identities of varying breadth from the menu available to them? \nRespondents will either receive one of two treatments (a radio interview on ration cards or public sewers), a placebo (a radio interview on cotton clothing), or no radio address. The ration card radio interview is intended to prime respondents to think about a narrow private good. The sewer radio interview is intended to prime respondents to think about a more encompassing public good in their settlement. Respondents will then be asked to rank the importance of the following four social identities: caste, religion, region of origin, and settlement. \n\nThe survey will be administered in a stratified random sample of 100 slums, 50 in Jaipur, Rajasthan and 50 in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. 2100 households will be sampled across the 100 slums. Households will be selected as follows. First, high-resolution satellite images will be generated for each sampled settlement from Google Earth. Next, pixels will be randomly selected and marked on the images. Enumerators will then be assigned the sampled households. \n", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "id": "20150619AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "Both co-investigators have conducted extensive qualitative fieldwork among the urban poor in India. Based on this fieldwork, we derived several traits we believed to be important in informing leadership selection in slum settlements. These include:\n\nH1: Education: More educated leaders are preferred to less educated leaders. \nH2: Occupation: \nH2a: Leaders whose occupations endow them with vertical connectivity to the municipal government are preferred to those whose occupations do not. \nH2b: Leaders whose occupations endow them horizontal connectivity to other slum dwellers are preferred to those whose occupations do not. \nH3: Partisanship: Co-partisan leaders are preferred to non-co-partisans. \nH4: Ethnicity: Co-ethnic leaders are preferred to non-co-ethnic leaders.\nDimensions of co-ethnicity: jati (caste), religion, and region-of-origin.\n\nH1-H4 are assessed through the forced-choice conjoint design described above. The main measure is a general preference for one of the two candidates for a slum leadership position. Some of these traits (notably ethnicity and partisanship) have long been viewed as important in formal leadership selection within India and other developing democracies. Yet there is little work identifying their importance in informal leadership/broker selection. Second, some of these traits (notably education and occupation) have explicitly not been seen as important as selection criteria for leaders in \u2018patronage-democracies\u2019 like India\u2019s. \n\nSecond, we anticipate variations in the strengths of the attributes tested in H1-H4, depending on the nature of the good the leader is expected to provide. For club goods that are indivisible within the slum, residents primarily care about a leader\u2019s ability to procure the good. We hypothesize that a leader\u2019s capability (i.e. education) and vertical connectivity are more important in such decisions, relative to co-ethnicity, co-partisanship, and horizontally connected occupations. By contrast we hypothesize that co-ethnicity, co-partisanship, and horizontally connected occupations are relatively more desirable leadership traits when respondents consider goods that are divisible within the slum. For such goods respondents must consider not only whether a leader can get the required good, but whether they are likely to distribute that good to their household specifically. \n\nThe above discussion can be summarized by the following hypothesis: \n\nH5: Relative to co-ethnicity, co-partisanship, and horizontally connected occupation effects, education and vertically connected occupation effects will be relatively stronger (weaker) in evaluations of potential leaders as providers of club goods (private goods). \n\nWe test H5 by measuring responses to leadership preferences on the conjoint experiment in terms of delivering specific club goods (water supply) and private goods (ration cards for purchasing subsidized foods) rather than the general leadership measure. \n\nFinally, we hypothesize that education and occupation will prove relatively more important than co-ethnicity in vertical political preferences than horizontal social preferences. In particular we anticipate education and occupation to be more desired attributes of informal slum leaders than potential neighbors, relative to co-ethnicity. We test this expectation by replicating the forced-choice conjoint design, but asking respondents to evaluate hypothetical individuals as potential neighbors rather than slum leaders. \n\nH6: Education and occupation effects will be stronger (weaker) relative to co-ethnicity effects in evaluations of potential slum leaders (neighbors) than potential slum neighbors (leaders). \n\nPriming Experiment\n\nWe also hypothesize that the salience of different social identities of slum residents varies with the breadth of a problem/good they are primed to think about. Specifically, we hypothesize:\n\nH1: Respondents primed to think of private household goods are more likely to prioritize narrow social identities (specifically caste) than the control group. \n\nH2: Respondents primed to think of club goods are more likely to prioritize broader social identities (specifically settlement) than the control group. \n\nTo test H1 and H2 we present respondents with 1-2 minute fake radio news segments. One radio news segment highlights the problem of accessing a private good (ration card), and one highlights the problem of obtaining a club good (sewer line). The segments are designed to be as similar as possible, and were recorded by professional radio personalities. Half of the control group will be made to listen to a placebo news segment unrelated to the outcome of interest (the benefits of cotton clothes over polyester clothes in the summer), and the other half will receive no news segment. \n\nFollowing the news segments and two simple follow-up questions to ensure respondent comprehension, we ask respondents to rank order four social identities using illustrative cards: caste, settlement, region of origin, and religion. The latter two fall between the former two in terms of breadth within the settlement, although which of these two proves more encompassing varies across different slum settlements. \n", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Community Governance and Leadership in India's Urban Slums", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Auerbach, Thachil", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "MORSEL Survey Firm", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "The primary statistical tests that will be used to test these hypotheses will be OLS regressions with indicator variables for different treatments.

However, Grossman, Humphreys, and Sacramone-Lutz (2014) recently argued that women may however be relatively more responsive to engaging in politics using decentralized SMS-based technology. New technology, in short, can have a flattening effect. This result was generated using a field experiment in Uganda, in which a random sample of individuals were personally invited by enumerators to send messages to politicians via an SMS platform. Take-up rates in that experiment were between 4--6%.\n\nA later intervention by the National Democratic Institute, in coordination with the Parliament of Uganda, designed and launched a platform enabling voters nationwide to communicate with politicians. In that intervention, voters were invited using 30 second long radio spots (ads), and not personally. Overall take up rates were much lower and men engaged at much higher rates than women, reflecting more traditional patterns of political communication.\n\nThe differences between these results are large and striking. Moreover they cannot easily be accounted for by some prominent accounts of differential participation such as different access to resources. One plausible explanation consistent with past work is that women and men respond differentially to a personal invitation to engage in politics. A direct personal invitation may itself have an empowering effect, signaling receptiveness and the possibility that political communication will make a difference. Specifically, an invitation to participate in politics may have a large marginal effect for marginalized populations, such as women and poor, who have lower political efficacy to begin with.\n\nTo assess the flattening effect of invitations to politics we will exploit an existing SMS platform, UBridge, developed in partnership between UNICEF's Ureport platform and Uganda's Governance, Accountability, Participation and Performance GAPP project and operative in Arua district, Uganda.

To do this, they used the current DW-Nominate estimates, and the key result in Shotts (2003) no longer holds (i.e., is no longer statistically significant).  The reason for the discrepancy is that as more votes happen over the years, each representative's DW-Nominate score for previous years moves a bit.

This technique will enable us to check whether the results in Shotts (2003) are robust to reasonable levels of error.  This method is far from perfect, because errors in DW-Nominates presumably are correlated both across time and across members.  However, to the best of our knowledge, no technique has been developed that would deal with this issue in DW-Nominate error.  Hence, we will treat the errors as being independent.\n\nThe second technique is to use a different measure of the ideology of elected officials, based on the Bonica (2014) estimates.\n\nMost of the input data for this study already exist and are readily available.  All data used in Shotts\u2019s original study are available in his replication archive.  Current DW-Nominate estimates, along with estimated standard errors are available from Keith Poole\u2019s website.  The Bonica scores are available from his website.  Simons and Mallinson have graciously provided the data they used in their extension of Shotts.\n\nAs of the time that this document is being submitted to EGAP, we have not conducted any analysis of the data.\n\nPart 1:  Re-Analysis of Shotts (2003)\n\n1-1.  Plot of raw DW-Nominates. To give a sense of the basic data before and after the 1990s redistricting, we will plot the Old and Current DW-Nominates for Southern Representatives and the House Median in the 102nd , 103rd, and 104th Congresses.  This will give a rough sense of whether the count of the number of Southern representatives to the left of the median is sensitive to errors in measurement for DW-Nominates.\n\n1-2.  Reestimation of the original model using samples obtained from Monte Carlo simulations that allow for different levels of error in Old-DW-Nominates (i.e., the ones used in Shotts 2003).   We will perform regressions for Shotts\u2019s key empirical specification (Table 1, p. 221) in a fashion similar to bootstrap resampling procedures.   All variables except the dependent variable Left of Median and its lag will be exactly as in Shotts (2003).  For the Left of Median variable, each iteration of the simulation will draw for each House Member in each year a DW-Nominate score from a normal distribution, with mean at his/her estimated mean.  The standard deviation of the draws will range from 0 to 0.2, in 0.01 unit increments.   Based on the work of Carroll et al (pp. 270-271) we believe that the most relevant standard deviation will be one around 0.05.  However, we are examining smaller and larger values as well.\n\nWe will perform 1000 iterations for each standard deviation between 0 and 0.2.  The product of this analysis will be a figure.  On the horizontal axis will be the standard deviation.  On the vertical axis will be the proportion of the 1000 iterations that resulted in a statistically-significant (at the conventional 0.05 level) positive coefficient on the key variable of interest in Shotts (2003), namely Fraction Majority-Minority. We also will plot the proportion of iterations that resulted in a statistically-significant negative coefficient on Fraction Majority-Minority, and report the mean and standard error from our iteration estimates. \n\nGiven that Shotts\u2019s results were no longer statistically significant in Simons and Mallinson\u2019s analysis (which used DW-Nominates that they downloaded recently from Poole\u2019s website), we expect that a small amount of noise will dramatically reduce the proportion of the time that there is a statistically-significant positive coefficient on Fraction Majority-Minority. However, to be clear, we don\u2019t have strong priors on how large the effect will be for different levels of the standard deviation.\n\nWe do not expect that there will be many statistically-significant negative coefficients on Fraction Majority-Minority, at least for small standard deviations.\n\n1-3.  Monte Carlo using Carroll et al (2009) estimated standard errors in Current-DW-Nominates for individual members.  This analysis will be very similar to part 1-2.  However, there will be only one level of standard deviation in the DW-Nominate for each member of Congress.  This will vary across members. Also, the DW-Nominates that we will use will be Current-DW-Nominates, because those are the ones for which estimated standard errors are available.\n\nWe will conduct 1000 iterations of the simulated regression, and will report the proportion of the time that the coefficient on Fraction Majority-Minority was positive and statistically significant and the proportion of the time that it was negative and statistically significant at the conventional 0.05 level.\n\n1-4.  Using Bonica scores to measure Left of Median.  Another, very different, way of assessing the robustness of Shotts\u2019s results is to use a different measure of politicians\u2019 ideal points.  We will do this using Bonica\u2019s (2014) measures, which are based on interest group contributions.  For this analysis we will replicate Table 1 from Shotts (2003), using the same data for every variable except Fraction Left of Median and its lag, both of which will be calculated using Bonica\u2019s estimates of members\u2019 ideological positions.  \n\n\nPart 2: Application to Simons and Mallinson\n\n2-1.  Monte Carlo simulation for different levels of error in Current-DW-Nominates.  As above, in part 1-2, we will re-run Simons and Mallinson\u2019s model (the \u201cConditional Effects Model\u201d in Table 3 of the March 2015 version of their paper) using a Monte Carlo Simulation with the standard deviation of the DW-Nominate estimates allowed to vary from 0 to 0.2 in 0.01 unit increments.  For each of the key independent variables (Fraction Majority-Minority, Unified Republican Control, Bipartisan Control, Majority-Minority X Unified Republican, and Majority-Minority X Bipartisan), we will plot the proportion of iterations that resulted in a statistically-significant positive coefficient as well as the proportion that resulted in a statistically-significant negative coefficient.\n\n2-2.   Monte Carlo simulation using Carroll et al (2009) estimated standard errors.  As in part 1-3, we will re-run Simons and Mallinson\u2019s model using a simulation with estimated standard errors for Current-DW-Nominates.  For each of the key independent variables, we will report the proportion of iterations in which the coefficient was positive and statistically significant as well as the proportion in which it was negative and statistically significant.", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "n/a", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": "no", "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "United States", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Registration prior to any research activities", "extra": []}, "timestamp": 42194.60340175926}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": 42195.0, "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "The goal of this project is to test the effects of newspaper op-eds on political attitudes.", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "id": "20150709AB", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "We expect that op-eds will move attitudes on their target issues but not on unrelated issues.

These studies have found that, rather than only responding to perceptions of benefits that a good provides, citizens are also responsive to perceptions about the cost they are paying. Rather than expecting a free lunch, they  want the benefits a good provides to be ``alignable\" with the cost they are paying. \n\nIn this study, we will test whether the same logic applies to attitudes toward government and public finances. And rather than staying in the lab, we will be going into the field, to survey subjects at a site of service delivery--a Chicago bus stop. The survey questions will be asked after subjects have been randomly assigned one of three conditions. In the Benefits condition, they will be told information about the per-passenger value of each bus ride. This approximates their benefits. In the Costs condition, they will be told information about the per-passenger cost of each bus ride (born by each passenger). This approximates their costs. And in the Costs and Benefits condition, they will be told information both about the per-passenger value of each ride (the benefit), as well as the per-passenger cost of each ride (the cost). All subjects will then answer standard questions about their attitudes toward government and public finance. We will test the extent to which perceptions about costs and benefits structure attitudes toward government and public finance; and we will do so in the natural laboratory of the city of Chicago.\n\nTo measure their attitudes toward government, taxing, and spending, all subjects will be asked the following questions:\n\na. On a scale from 1 to 100, how do you feel about paying taxes for government services? 100 means you feel very warm and positive about paying taxes for government services, and 1 means you feel very cold and negative toward paying taxes for government services.\n\nb.

If polarization has at least some negative consequences, are there ways to reduce/ameliorate it? \n\nHere, I focus on whether it is possible to reduce affective polarization, that is, dislike/distrust of the opposing party (Iyengar, Sood, and Lelkes 2012; Mason 2013). Manifestations of affective polarization include lower feeling thermometer ratings, more negative trait evaluations of the other party (i.e., being more likely to rate them as dishonest, untrustworthy, etc.), and in some cases, more discrimination against the opposite party in various tasks (Iyengar and Westwood 2015). Note that affective polarization is theoretically and empirically distinct from ideological or issue-based polarization (see Mason 2015). Affective polarization is dislike of the opposition, ideological or issue-based polarization is a difference between the issue positions of Democrats and Republicans (on issue-based polarization, see Fiorina, Abrams, and Pope 2005).  \n\nIn this study, I examine a particular intervention that might reduce such affective polarization: priming national identity, rather than partisan identity, in order to reduce partisan hostility and competition. If subjects are primed as Americans\u2014rather than as Democrats/Republicans\u2014they will respond with less hostility to the other side. They will see the other party as closer to themselves: as common members of a shared identity (Americans) rather than as competing members of separate out-group (opposing partisans). \n\nThere is strong psychological evidence for this sort of a prime rooted in the Common Intergroup Identity Model (Gartner et al. 1989; Gartner and Dovidio 2000). This model argues that individuals have superordinate and subordinate identities. When the superordinate (American) identity is primed, they reduce their hostility to the opposing subordinate (partisan) group. This follows because of a pattern of reclassification: instead of seeing the other subordinate group as an outgroup, they now see them as a fellow member of a shared ingroup (the superordinate group), and attach a positive valence to them because of shifts \u201cinvolving pro-ingroup bias\u201d (Gartner and Dovidio 2000, 42; see also Brewer and Brown 1998, 580-1). \n\nIn this context, suppose a Democrat is asked to evaluate Republicans. If he sees the Republican as a Republican\u2014and hence as a member of an outgroup\u2014then he will tend to evaluate them quite negatively (consistent with Iyengar, Sood, and Lelkes 2012). However, if he primarily sees Republicans as Americans\u2014a shared in-group\u2014then he will evaluate them more warmly (likely still not as warmly as he evaluates other Democrats, but more warmly than when they are just Republicans). So by emphasizing a common identity, hostility toward another group decreases (see also Theiss-Morse 2009).  \n\nWhat it means to be \u201cAmerican\u201d is itself a difficult question, subject to much scholarly debate (see, among many others, Smith 1997; Schildkraut 2011). Here, by American identity, I mean American national identity: \u201ca subjective or internalized sense of belonging to the [American] nation\u201d (Huddy and Khatib 2007, 65). This conception grows out of social identity theory (Tajfel and Turner 1979), and represents group membership based on a psychological sense of group membership (in this case, a sense that one is an American). This is not tied, however, to an endorsement of a particular ideology or political belief, but rather reflects \u201cbeing or feeling American\u201d (Huddy and Khatib 2007, 65). Ordinary citizens think that this sense of belonging is an important part of being \u201cAmerican.\u201d Schildkraut (2011) asks respondents which factors they think should be important to being an American. More than 90 percent say that \u201cfeeling American\u201d and \u201cthinking of oneself as American\u201d should be important components of being an American (table 3.1, p.45). This sense of national identity transcends racial, ethnic, and partisan/ideological boundaries (Huddy and Khatib 2007; Citrin, Duff, and Wong 2001). \n\nSo the basic hypothesis is straightforward: priming American national identity will reduce affective partisan polarization. But the effect will not be equally efficacious for all respondents. Such effects should be more muted among those are sorted (i.e., those whose overall ideological outlook matches their partisan orientation, see Levendusky 2009). As Mason (2015) illustrates, those who are sorted (in her words, have aligned identities) show more hostility toward the other party and see them as more of a threat. Given that party and ideology align and are quite strong in this group, their identity as a partisan is a strong and entrenched one, and should be more resistant to this type of priming.  The same logic should apply equally well to those who identify most strongly with a party (i.e., strong partisans). \n\nThere is one final group for whom the treatment should be especially effective: immigrants. Immigrants effectively have \u201cbought in\u201d to the American ideal and American dream, and should see themselves as having a stronger attachment to American identity. Consistent with this, immigrants, particularly Hispanic immigrants, have stronger identity as Americans than other Americans (de la Garza, Falcon, and Garcia 1996; Citrin, Lerman, Murakami, and Pearson 2007). Given this, immigrants might be more responsive to this sort of superordinate American identity priming. Further, those who are more acculturated in the U.S., and have absorbed those norms of Americanism, should be more responsive to the prime. For example, those who have been in the U.S. longer, or are second or third (vs. first) generation immigrants, more strongly identify as Americans (e.g., Schildkraut 2011).", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "id": "20150713AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "That gives the following 4 hypotheses to be tested: \n\nH1: Priming American national identity will reduce affective polarization. \n\nH2: Such effects should be weaker among those who are sorted (i.e., those whose general ideological outlook matches their partisan orientation).  \n\nH3: Such effects should be weaker among those who are strong partisans \n\nH4: Such effects should be especially pronounced among immigrants to the U.S. \nH4A: The effects among immigrants should be stronger among immigrants who are more acculturated.", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Americans, Not Partisans: Can Priming American National Identity Reduce Polarization?", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Levendusky", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "TBA (likely SSI, still in final stage of negotiation with them)", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "Regression/difference of means testing of the survey experimental data.

This variation means that the inferences researchers draw and the replicability of the study can depend on who runs the study. Regardless of whether the relationship between characteristics of the interviewer and the observed variation in responses is perceived to be a benefit 1 or a threat, 2 it is useful for researchers to be cognizant of the circumstances in which we might expect this relationship to be most likely to occur. For example, it is often suggested that responses in online surveys are less likely to be affected by attributes of the researcher than in other survey methods. \n\nIn this paper we explore how attributes of the researcher affect responses in online surveys. In particular, we use a survey experiment that explicitly manipulates the race and gender cued by the researcher name on the informed consent page. The informed consent page is generally required by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of research universities to be displayed at the start of every internet-based survey. Manipulating the researcher name allows us to test how information conveyed about the race and gender of the researcher through the informed consent page affects survey responses. We focus on gender and race because these two factors can be clearly conveyed through names (Bertrand & Mullainathan, 2004; Milkman et al., 2012), and have been central to the existing literature on surveys and identity. The experiment is a 2x2 factorial design, where the first factor is the putative gender of the investigator (male or female) and the second is the investigator\u2019s putative race (white or black).", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "id": "20150717AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "H1 : Assignment to an investigator name that is commonly perceived to be female/black will increase reported support for policies that provide for and protect the rights of women/blacks, and decreases responses that indicate prejudice against these groups.\n\nH2 : Attention and effort will be greatest among subjects assigned to a putatively white, male investigator.", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Investigator Characteristics and Respondent Behavior in Online Surveys", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Huff, Kruszewska, Lucas, Strezhnev, White", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Researchers", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "For Hypothesis 1, we estimate two separate treatment effects. The first is the effect of assignment to a putatively female name on the probability that a respondent indicates that they believe that women should have an equal role in the workforce. The second is the effect of assignment to a putatively black name on the respondent\u2019s racial resentment scale. We expect that the effect for the former will be positive while the latter will be negative. For Hypothesis 2, we will estimate the effect of assignment to a putatively white and male name on the probability that a respondent correctly completes both of the attention check assignments. We expect this effect estimate to be positive. For estimation, we will fit a linear probability model of the outcome on treatment and compute standard errors via a nonparametric bootstrapping procedure. While not needed for identification, we will include respondent-level covariates (e.g. gender, income, education) in the regression model in order to increase the efficiency of our estimator. Because respondents have the option to stop taking the survey after treatment is assigned, there is concern that an analysis conditional on survey completion will be biased for the average treatment effect if treatment also affects the probability that a respondent will drop out. To obtain unbiased treatment effect estimates in this situation, we adopt an estimation strategy similar to that of Rotnitzky & Robins (1995) and weight each respondent observation in the outcome regression by its estimated probability of not dropping out of the sample. We estimate this probability via a logistic regression of completion on treatment using the entire set of respondents (those that both completed and did not complete the survey). Our rejection levels for two-sided hypothesis tests of whether the average treatment effects differ from zero are calibrated to correct for problems of multiple testing. We are willing to tolerate an overall Type I error rate of \u03b1 = .05. With three main hypothesis tests, we could obtain a conservative rejection threshold for each individual hypothesis test of .05/3 = .017 using the Bonferroni correction. This controls the Familywise Type I Error Rate and guarantees that the probability of any single erroneous rejection in the set of tests is less than or equal to .05. However, this approach sacrifices a significant amount of power. A less conservative but more powerful approach is to set a rejection threshold to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR). We use the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to set a rejection level for the hypothesis tests (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995). This entails a two-step procedure where we order the 3 p-values of the individual hypothesis tests from smallest to largest, p (1) , ..., p (3) and then set our rejection level to p (k) , where k is the largest value of i that satisfies p (i) \u2264 3 i \u03b1. This procedure controls the expected share of false hypothesis rejections out of the total number of rejections to be no greater than .05. We do not specify any ex-ante interactions of the treatment effects with baseline covari- ates. However, because the mechanism through which any treatment effects operate are of significant interest, we will conduct exploratory analyses of potential treatment effect hetero- geneity by estimating models with interactions between treatment and respondent identity variables. Among other interactions, we are interested in seeing whether any average treat- ment effect is primarily driven by behavior changes among men (in the case of the gender treatment) and white respondents (in the case of the race treatment). We will attempt to replicate any promising results from these exploratory analyses in a follow-up experiment that explicitly registers interactive hypotheses prior to the experiment.\n\nIn this preregistration plan, we outline an experiment that tests whether or not investigator characteristics have an effect on subjects responses and subject effort. This design permits direct tests of these hypotheses. In addition to these primary hypothesis tests, we hope to conduct an exploratory analyses of heterogeneous treatment effects, which will serve as the basis for a second experiment to test the mechanisms that we hope to identify in the experiment laid out in this plan.

We believe that this difference in attitude strength stems from both the well-established psychological tendency for \u201closses to loom larger than gains\u201d and the tendency for political conservatives to be especially sensitive to such losses. \n\nIn particular, we argue that the nature of lawmaking itself, by which most legislation proposes changes to the status quo, means that political conservatives are more likely to perceive of policies as taking something of value from them. This perception, in turn, leads conservatives to often be in opposition to new policies and thus, per our theory, hold stronger opinions than supporters. This imbalance in strength of opinion, perhaps in conjunction with institutional features of U.S. lawmaking, provides political conservatives with a public policy advantage: in most cases, when the opponents of a public policy have stronger opinions than the proponents, very high levels of support are necessary to overcome the opposition. \n\nIn preliminary research, we have found descriptive evidence that \u2013 across a range of issues \u2013 conservatives in the United States do hold stronger opinions, on average, than liberals.

We will estimate SATE using randomization inference taking into account our blocking design. \n\nTreatment-by-Covariate Heterogeneous Effects. We will estimate heterogeneous effects using multiplicative interaction effects within an OLS regression model, with theoretical justification from Lorentzen, et al. (2014). We are interested in heterogeneous treatment effects across the following covariates:\n\u2022 pre-treatment PITI score\n\u2022 pre-treatment measures of city-level civil society mobilization \n\u2022 pre-treatment large firm dominance\n\u2022 pre-treatment municipal budget revenues\n\u2022 pre-treatment environmental quality measures\n\nWe realize that treatment-by-covariate heterogeneous effects are exploratory in nature because any covariate measure can be confounded. Given our small sample size, we do not expect to be able to test these heterogeneous treatment effects simultaneously. Instead, we test our main heterogeneous treatment effects (pre-treatment PITI score and pre-treatment measures of city-level civil society mobilization) together. We run each of the other covariates separately to explore plausibility. We interpret each with appropriate caution because none is causally identified. However, given the literature (Lorentzen et al. 2014), we feel it is important to offer some test of the observable implications. \n\nIntermediate Outcomes. We will estimate SATE for the intermediate outcomes using the same randomization inference procedure in light of our blocking design. To the extent that we find a treatment effect on the intermediate outcomes, we will then complete causal mediation analysis for the main effect in light of these outcomes (Imai et al. 2011). We will be clear to qualify the findings in light of the unmeasured covariates that might confound the mediators.\n\nFor the measures that can be used as a time series (Weibo data; newspaper data; petition data), we will conduct difference-in-difference time series analysis on a monthly basis. This will allow us to assess the time path of treatment effects. It is possible that attention to pollution and transparency will quickly fade or that the treatment effects on intermediate outcomes will persist. Thus, we will compute average treatment effects at different time periods after the release of the PITI scores by comparing the difference between treatment and control groups for the difference from the pre-treatment measure to the time period under consideration, again using randomization inference. \n\nInstrumental Variable Estimation for Regulatory Outcomes. We will use two-stage least squares instrumental variable estimation to test the effects of transparency on regulatory performance and environmental outcomes. As noted, we will conduct a series of placebo tests to justify the exclusion restriction for treatment assignment as an instrument.\n\nThe most significant threat to the instrumental variable approach is that the disclosure of PITI scores will activate environmental activism, which could have impacts both on the transparency practices and regulatory actions of cities. Thus, in measuring civil society and government pressures for a response to the PITI disclosure, we must carefully consider whether pressure was increased only to improve transparency or whether the PITI disclosure causes more general environmental advocacy. To address this concern, we split our measures of intermediate outcomes and code which promote increased transparency and which promote better environmental practices. To the extent that pressure is only mobilized for increased transparency, then we consider our instrumental variables approach warranted. If the exclusion restriction cannot be maintained, we will complete causal mediation analysis, though admittedly this requires assumptions about the data generation process (Imai et al. 2011).\n\nWe are also interested in the possibility that the inclusion of new cities in the public PITI release will induce other cities to update their transparency practices and their regulation of pollution. It may be the case that anticipating further transparency requirements, pressures from civil society, and regulatory effort from government in response to perceptions about the likely expansion of PITI in the future, cities in the control condition might react as well.

Asking someone to express their probabilistic beliefs quantitatively, especially when those beliefs rest on subjective foundations, is thus like asking a scholar who writes in English to translate her work into Dutch \u2013 she could do it, but she would presumably make mistakes in the process (Zimmer 1994, Wallsten and Budescu 1995). \n\nThese translation errors could take several forms. Numeric expressions could bias probability assessments, either by shifting the mean of these assessments or by pushing probability estimates away from certainty (that is, further from zero percent or 100 percent). In principle, this should not occur in national security analysis. Using official qualitative lexicons (e.g., so-called \"words of estimative probability\") requires determining where a probability falls along the number line and then selecting the appropriate term that fits this description. Systematic differences in means among these assessments would indicate that analysts are using these lexicons improperly. But that does not mean one should ignore the possibility. Asking analysts to express their judgments numerically could generate analytic misgivings, or make analysts concerned with how their estimates will be evaluated after the fact. Any such discomfort could bias probability assessments or influence the variance of those assessments. If analysts find it confusing to express subjective judgments quantitatively, then this could add \u201cnoise\u201d to their responses. \n\nAny critique that the use of numeric probabilities harms the quality of national security analysis depends on two empirical claims. First, analysts asked to assess probabilities using numbers and words should generate different distributions of responses. Second, the numerical assessments should be less accurate, on average. If analysts simply assign numerical and verbal probabilities interchangeably, with no discernible change in accuracy, then one cannot say that the numerical assessments are any worse from an informational standpoint. Thus the first hypothesis we seek to evaluate is Hypothesis A1: When national security analysts express probabilities using numbers as opposed to words, their estimates will be less accurate, on average. \n\nA second issue to consider is whether asking national security analysts to assess numeric probabilities would influence the confidence that they attach to their assessments. In national security analysis, \u201clikelihood\u201d refers to the chances that a judgment is true and \u201cconfidence\u201d reflects the quality of evidence and inferences supporting that judgment. If analysts are uncomfortable expressing numeric probabilities, this could systematically reduce their confidence levels in performing analysis. It is unclear that this would make analyses worse, especially as international relations scholars typically believe that national security analysts tend towards overconfidence (Heuer 1999, Johnson 2004). Nevertheless, there are only grounds for skepticism here if the use of numeric probabilities actually affects analysts\u2019 confidence levels. Thus we explore Hypothesis A2: Numeric expression reduces analysts\u2019 confidence in making probability assessments. \n\n\n**How numeric probability assessment could influence decision making**\n\nConcern about how decision makers interpret numeric probabilities also engage issues of bias, variance, and confidence. Because there is rarely an objective way to evaluate the overall quality of national security decisions (Betts 2000), we lay out several hypotheses individually.\n\nHypothesis D1: Numeric probabilities bias decision makers\u2019 support for risky actions. One common worry is that expressing probabilities numerically could make analyses seem more rigorous than they really are. In principle, this could bias the way national security officials evaluate choices under uncertainty. However, the direction of such bias is unclear. For example, if General McChrystal had told President Obama that there was a \u201c60 percent chance\u201d that the Afghan Surge would succeed, would this have made the decision seem more defensible than framing it as an \u201cacceptable risk\u201d? Or would the extra precision have highlighted the residual probability of failure and thus made the President less likely to commit? Without empirical evidence, it is difficult know which of these effects (if either) should be potential concerns.\n\nHypothesis D2: Numeric probabilities influence the strength of dominant tendencies. The impact of expressing numeric probabilities may be conditional on context. Numerical expressions may amplify dominant tendencies, making decision makers more likely to accept policies that appear favorable and less likely to accept policies that appear too risky. Consistent with this view, Dieckmann, Slovic, and Peters (2009) argue that decision makers pay more attention to probabilities when those cues are expressed numerically. However, it is also possible that national security decision makers would be uncomfortable basing decisions on numeric probabilities and that this would attenuate dominant tendencies. Again, we cannot say objectively which of these possibilities would help or harm the quality of decision making. However, if the use of numeric probabilities leaves the strength of dominant tendencies unaffected, this would eliminate another potential grounds for concern.\n\nHypothesis D3: Numeric probabilities reduce decision makers\u2019 willingness to gather additional information. One of the crucial reasons why analysts should distinguish between likelihood and confidence is because this should influence decision makers\u2019 willingness to delay action in order to gather additional information (Friedman and Zeckhauser 2015). Thus another version of the idea that numeric probabilities appear \u201ctoo rigorous\u201d is that this mode of expression may lead decision makers to undervalue conducting additional analysis. This could increase decision makers\u2019 willingness to act immediately, even if it does not alter the way they rank-order policy options.\n\nHypothesis D4: Numeric probabilities increase the variance of decision makers\u2019 views. If decision makers find numeric probabilities to be confusing then, as with analysts, this could add unnecessary \u201cnoise\u201d to their reactions. This would be particularly concerning to proponents of numeric expressions, as one of the main justifications for communicating probabilities precisely is to prevent unnecessary variance in how decision makers respond to information.\n\nHypothesis D5: Numeric probabilities alter decision makers\u2019 confidence in evaluating policy options. If numeric probabilities confuse decision makers, then this could manifest as lower confidence in policy evaluations. If decision makers believe that numeric probabilities are more rigorous than they really are, this could create false confidence in taking action based on ambiguous information. \n\nThese claims all have real theoretical significance for understanding the psychology of national security decision making, and they also have real practical significance for determining how to assess uncertainty effectively. However, none of these claims has ever been tested directly. We know of no instance where scholars have directly demonstrated the potentially harmful effects of using numerical probabilities in national security analysis and decision making.", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Assessing Uncertainty in National Security Decision Making", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Friedman, Lerner, Zeckhauser", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Researchers", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "This research involves two original experiments. Experiment 1 asks respondents to assess probabilities. We randomly assign one group of respondents to assess probabilities using \u201cwords of estimative probability\u201d and another group of respondents to assess probabilities using numerical percentages. We then examine whether these modes of expression influence the content of what analysts report. \n\nExperiment 2 asks respondents to evaluate scenarios that involve making national security decisions under uncertainty. We randomly determine which respondents see this uncertainty described using words versus numbers. We then examine whether quantifying probability assessments changes the way respondents evaluate actions in these scenarios.\n\nWe will conduct these experiments using Qualtrics surveys administered to students at U.S. War Colleges and to respondents from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). War College students provide an elite sample comprising active-duty U.S. military officers at the rank of Lieutenant Colonel or Colonel. This sample of national security officials provides plausible external validity for our results. The MTurk sample expands our statistical power, while allowing us to test for systematic differences between responses from elite and general samples (Hyde 2015, Renshon 2015). \n\n\n**Experiment 1: Does the Use of Numeric Probabilities Influence Analysis?**\n\nExperiment 1 asks respondents to make probability assessments in response to 40 questions about foreign policy and national security. Entries include \u201cIn your opinion, what are the chances that at least 80 countries currently recognize Taiwan\u2019s independence from China?\u201d and \u201cIn your opinion, what are the chances that Israel receives more foreign aid than any other country in the world?\u201d \n\nThese questions span a broad range of topics relating to national security and foreign affairs. We also vary questions across three analytic \u201ctypes.\u201d Thirty questions have factual answers. Five questions involve verifiable predictions (e.g., \u201cIn your opinion, what are the chances that within the next six months, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad will be killed or no longer living in Syria?\u201d). Five questions involve nonverifiable statements about current or previous states of the world (e.g., \u201cIn your opinion, what are the chances that high-ranking members of Pakistan\u2019s intelligence services knew that Osama bin Laden was hiding in Abbottabad?\u201d). This distribution of question types allows us to score a large volume of respondents\u2019 predictions, while exploring the possibility that analysts might respond different to these tasks. \n\nAt the beginning of the survey, we randomly assign respondents to \u201cqualitative\u201d or \u201cquantitative\u201d assessment conditions. Respondents in the quantitative assessment condition convey probability assessments through text-entry of numerical percentages. Respondents in the qualitative assessment condition convey probability assessments by selecting the most appropriate \u201cword of estimative probability\u201d from a commonly-used spectrum with seven, evenly-spaced terms (\u201cremote,\u201d \u201cvery unlikely,\u201d \u201cunlikely,\u201d \u201ceven chance,\u201d \u201clikely,\u201d \u201cvery likely,\u201d \u201calmost certainly\u201d). \n\nWe present questions in random order. For the last 10 questions on each survey, we also ask respondents to indicate the level of confidence (7-point scale) they assigned to each assessment.\n\nThese data allow us to test whether the use of numeric probabilities influences analysis in the manner of the hypotheses articulated above. The \u201cwords of estimative probability\u201d spectrum used in the qualitative expression condition divides the number line into seven equal segments. We will translate integer percentages that respondents submitted in the quantitative expression condition into corresponding qualitative terms. We will then compare the distributions of responses for individual questions and for aggregate data. We will compare the accuracy of these responses using the common Brier scoring method, along with other proper scoring rules. \n\n\n**Experiment 2: Does the Use of Numeric Probabilities Influence Decision Making?**\n\nExperiment 2 presents respondents with scenarios involving national security decisions under uncertainty: a proposed hostage rescue mission, a proposed drone strike, and a proposed decision to support local security forces. At the end of each scenario, the survey asks respondents how much they support taking the proposed action immediately (7-point scale), how much they support waiting for additional information before deciding (7-point scale), and how confident they are in making these assessments (7-point scale). We also ask respondents to \u201cwrite a few sentences\u201d justifying their views. Soliciting these text responses allows us to code the integrative complexity of respondents\u2019 reasoning (Baker-Brown et al. 1992), to confirm whether respondents appeared to be taking the survey seriously, and to encourage respondents to consider their views in detail. \n\nWe randomly assign respondents to qualitative and quantitative expression conditions. In the qualitative expression condition, all probability assessments within scenarios are expressed using \u201cwords of estimative probability.\u201d In the quantitative expression condition, we translate those words into numerical percentages using the probability closest to the middle of the range that each \u201cword of estimative probability\u201d represented that was also a multiple of 0.05. Thus we translate \u201ceven chance\u201d to \u201c50 percent,\u201d we translate \u201clikely\u201d to \u201c65 percent,\u201d and so forth. \n\nWe randomize the order in which these scenarios appeared. We also randomly present these respondents with one of three versions of each scenario, across which we vary probability assessments. We designed different versions of these scenarios to represent \u201coptimistic,\u201d \u201cneutral,\u201d or \u201cpessimistic\u201d information about proposed actions. Varying this information is crucial for testing Hypothesis D2 about whether numeric probabilities influence dominant tendencies. Exploring variations in responses across scenario versions also indicates the extent to which respondents\u2019 views actually depended on the information contained in the scenario\u2019s probability assessments. \n\n\n**Additional variables**\n\nAt the end of each survey, we ask all respondents to complete a three-question adaptive Berlin Numeracy Test (Cokeley et al. 2012). Thus we can examine whether any differences between qualitative/quantitative treatment conditions is influenced by respondents\u2019 numerical fluency. We then ask all respondents to indicate their gender, their race, and whether English was their native language. We also ask MTurk respondents to indicate their year of birth, their education level, and whether they were U.S. citizens.\n\nThese procedures were approved by IRB committees at Dartmouth College, Harvard University, and the National Defense University.", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "United States", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Registration prior to assignment of treatment", "extra": []}, "timestamp": 42219.91983796296}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": 42236.0, "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "What is the effect of group gender composition on men and women's 1) group behavior dynamics, 2) individual confidence and self-efficacy, and 3) attitudes toward their group experience and the overall academic program.\n\nExisting research in behavioral social sciences suggests that group-level features, such as the group\u2019s gender composition, may have an effect on each individual group members\u2019 performance and overall group efficiency.

Thus, many questions remain about the findings\u2019 relevance to real-world settings and about the way in which repeated group interactions over time exacerbate or ameliorate these patterns. In short, we know very little about whether these findings transfer to settings and situations that matter.\n\nOur experiment is designed to address these concerns by partnering with the MPA and Accounting Junior Core programs at Brigham Young University's Marriott School of Management. BYU Marriott School programs' groups work closely together throughout the semester, and the group experience dominates the first-year students' experience with the program. Group work is emphasized in these programs to mimic the modern workplace. Yet, several program directors are concerned that the balance of women and men in each group may be influencing the quality of this group experience, such as in Marriott School student teams.

This effect will be magnified for rural and low-income respondents. \nH2: Respondents exposed to a condition in which the candidate promises to improve education will be least popular among the four possible conditions. \n\nForeign Policy\nH1: Respondents will prefer the candidate taking a harsh line on India relative to peace with India. \nH2: Respondents who have traveled or lived abroad, or who have family members who have traveled or lived abroad, will be in favor of peace with India compared to those who have not. \nH3: Respondents who have only completed primary education (or less) or respondents who have completed higher education will prefer candidates who advocate a peaceful relationship with India at greater rates than respondents who only have secondary education or some secondary education. \nH4: Respondents from Punjab, or who are ethnically Punjabi, will prefer candidates who advocate a harsh line with India at a greater rate than respondents from other provinces or non-Punjabi ethnicities. \nH5: Young (< 30 years old) and old (>55 years old) respondents are more likely to prefer candidates who support peace with India than middle-aged respondents (between approximately 30 and 55 years old). \nH6: Respondents who identify their sect as Shi\u2019a are more likely to prefer candidates who support peace with India than those who identify as Sunni. \nH7: Respondents will punish candidates affiliated with right-of-center parties (PML-N, PTI) less than those candidates affiliated with left-of-center parties (PPP, MQM, ANP) for supporting peace with India. \n\nHypotheses for Vignette Experiment\n\nH1: Individuals will express support of a co-ethnic candidate even when he/she does not have access to many resources and is therefore unable to provide them goods & services. This helps support my theory that ethnic appeals to voters are not merely clientelistic appeals. That is, there is a psychic/non-instrumental benefit that voters get from voting for co-ethnic parties. \nH2: This effect will be magnified in multi-ethnic arenas of competition (Urban Sindh) and for low-income individuals. \nH3: Individuals who have previously faced or been exposed to violence will be more likely to support co-ethnic candidates regardless of their access to resources. These individuals will be more likely to support a co-ethnic candidate without resources than a non co-ethnic with resources. \nH4: Individuals will prefer co-ethnic candidates with resources to co-ethnic candidates without resources. \n", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "What matters to Pakistani Voters?

Concerned that low student test scores might affect their job security and future prospects, teachers spend an increasing amount of class time preparing students for tests instead of teaching them new material (Ravitch, 2011). Some teachers even provide students with unauthorized assistance in ad- vance of or during tests (Jacob and Levitt, 2003; Koretz, 2005). More rarely, teachers have falsified test results (Samuels, 2011). School administrators are also affected by high-stakes testing. Under pressure from state governments, school boards, and communities to increase test scores, principals now spend the majority of their work hours trying to develop new ways of maximizing student performance (Madaus, Russell and Higgins, 2009).

Such marks might limit the extent of help provided to a job seeker because of concerns about courtesy stigma; yet they might also facilitate help by triggering sympathy. Specifically, we focus on accident-related burn scars with varying degrees of implied responsibility. \n\nWe make three distinctions. First, we distinguish between (a) socially observable forms of job search help (i.e., those that involve the activation of the help provider\u2019s other network ties to assist the job seeker with information or referrals) and (b) more personal types of help (i.e., assistance that does not require the cooperation of others, such as providing feedback on the job seeker\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9). Second, we distinguish two types of stigmatizing marks: existential marks, for which the help seeker is not responsible, and achieved marks, for which the help seeker bears some responsibility (Falk 2001).

The first is that online comments tend to be more emotional, less factually oriented, and use stronger language than elite discourse or journalistic reporting. The second, and obviously related, issue is that the identity of the person making the comment is usually anonymized, which further clouds the potential quality of the signal. Third, the fact that such comments are anonymized means that many take the opportunity to voice stronger or more emotional opinions (perhaps more partisan in their tone) than would be socially accepted in the absence of such anonymity.  Indeed, the nature of online commentary means that a greater share of opinions are expressed, both in range and also in terms of non-elite opinion.

Despite an increase in sociopolitical conflicts globally, we know relatively little about the factors that influence divestment from conflict zones.\n In this project we examine the decision of foreign divestment from Burma. We do so by drawing on institutional and social movement theories, which consider how firms respond to governments and activists, respectively. Consistent with these theories, we contend that MNEs will divest from conflict zones when (1) home governments enact legislation critical of a host country and (2) NGO and shareholder activists put pressure on MNEs to act in a socially responsible manner. \nIn an observational component of this project, we examine the divestment decisions of 442 MNEs from thirty-one countries operating in Burma between 1995 and 2002. During this time period, many MNEs exited the country while the incumbent military government continued repression of its constituents. Burma is a salient context to explore divestment given the multitude of pressures that MNEs confronted in this decision process. Our study also offers insight into the strategic responses of MNEs in adverse conditions by comparing which factors weigh heavily in MNE strategy.  \nWe couple these observational data with a survey experiment in the United States focusing on consumer reactions to calls for boycotts.

The project is part\nof a broader comparative project funded by the Experiments in Governance and Politics (EGAP).\nFor more information on this broader project, please see here.\nThe project seeks to assess the role of information dissemination on the selection of political\ncandidates by voters. It builds on a series of recent field experiments about this question that\nhave been conducted around the world over the past decade (Humphreys and Weinstein, 2010;\nBanerjee et al., 2011; de Figueiredo, Hidalgo and Kasahara, 2011; Chong et al., 2011; Casey,\nGlennerster and Bidwell, 2015).1 The goal of these field experiments is to understand whether\nproviding voters with information about candidates leads them to choose \"better\" politicians.\nIn India, our focus is on whether voters choose candidates with fewer criminal charges once\nwe directly provide them with a summary of criminal charges against each candidate in the\nconstituency.2 3 In this project we are not only interested in the effect of information, but also the\nidentity of those delivering the information about politicians. In particular, we vary the identity\nof the individual providing information to the voter.\nThe study will take place in 600 polling booths across the state of Bihar, North India, ahead\nof much-anticipated state-level elections scheduled for October-November of 2015 (in several\nphases). State assembly elections are organized every five years, unless a government is dissolved\nearly, and set the stage for considerable electoral battles among the main political parties. Because\nstates play a key role in the Indian federal system regarding the distribution of benefits (Chandra,\n2004), and because regional parties have increasingly become important in India, state assembly\nelections are now often seen as the most important elections in India.\nthere are several important reasons why it makes sense for a field experiment on information and\naccountability to focus on the state of Bihar. Bihar is often seen \u2013 along with the eastern part of the\nadjacent state of Uttar Pradesh \u2013 as a hotbed for \"criminal politics\" and corruption in the country\n(Witsoe, 2005; Berenschot, 2008; Michelutti, 2010; Vaishnav, 2012). According to Vaishnav (2012),\n\"on a percentage basis, Bihar sends the largest number of politicians facing pending criminal\nindictments to its state assembly of any state in India.\" As can be ascertained from publicly\navailable electoral affidavits, this alarming trend is not specific to a single party. In the last\nassembly elections in 2010, all the main political parties in Bihar fielded candidates facing major\ncriminal charges in the Assembly elections, with the then ruling JD(U)/BJP coalition topping the\nlist with 72 such nominees. An informational intervention with a stated objective to decrease\nthe number of winning candidates facing criminal charges is thus particularly relevant to the\npolitical context of Bihar, as several local civil society organizations \u2013 especially the Association\nfor Democratic Reforms (ADR) \u2013 have in the past attempted to mount awareness campaigns\nthat echo our efforts in this proposal. A field experiment of the type we describe in this proposal\nallows us to build on these efforts and test what various types of informational interventions, and\nthe various types of politically relevant individuals that may be the bearers of this information,\ncan do to increase accountability against \"criminal types.\"", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "600 polling booths in 25 constituencies", "extra": []}, "id": "20150925AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "See section 5 of attached PAP", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "The Effect of Information and Local Intermediaries on Vote Choice: A Field Experiment in Bihar", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": 42193.0, "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "STUDY00028849", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Simon Chauchard, Neelanjan Sircar", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Sunai Consultancy (Patna, Bihar, India).

How can economic development programming be done in a way that addresses deep-seated social and political frustrations that drive young people into insurgencies?\n\nPromoting stability has become the primary, underlying aim of nearly all major development donors operating in fragile and conflict afflicted states. Youth play a critical role in this dynamic as they are both the large recruitment pool for potential violent spoilers -- representing a significant proportion of the population in many developing countries --and will eventually take positions of power and influence in their society. Nowhere are the issues of youth and stability more salient than in Afghanistan. The nation is currently experiencing a significant \"youth bulge\" (nearly 70% of the population is 35 years and under according to UNDP), which, combined with unemployment and social fragmentation, has raised concerns for a significant increase in insurgent recruitment and violence.\n\nMany aid actors see employment generation as the best bet for promoting stability in Afghanistan and other fragile states. The underlying assumption is that employment will reduce people's likelihood to be recruited into or resort to political violence by providing them with incentives to disengage with violent movements. However, a number of studies have begun to question the prominence of youth joblessness in explaining their role in violent movements.

The second is the\neffect of assignment to a putatively black name on the respondent\u2019s racial resentment scale.\nWe expect that the effect for the former will be positive while the latter will be negative.\nFor Hypothesis 2, we will estimate the effect of assignment to a putatively white and male\nname on the probability that a respondent correctly completes both of the attention check\nassignments. We expect this effect estimate to be positive. For estimation, we will fit a\nlinear probability model of the outcome on treatment and compute standard errors via a\nnonparametric bootstrapping procedure. While not needed for identification, we will include\nrespondent-level covariates (e.g. gender, income, education) in the regression model in order\nto increase the efficiency of our estimator.\n\nOur rejection levels for two-sided hypothesis tests of whether the average treatment effects\ndiffer from zero are calibrated to correct for problems of multiple testing. We are willing\nto tolerate an overall Type I error rate of \u03b1 = .05. With three main hypothesis tests,\nwe could obtain a conservative rejection threshold for each individual hypothesis test of\n.05/3 = .017 using the Bonferroni correction. This controls the Familywise Type I Error\nRate and guarantees that the probability of any single erroneous rejection in the set of\ntests is less than or equal to .05. However, this approach sacrifices a significant amount of\npower. A less conservative but more powerful approach is to set a rejection threshold to\ncontrol the False Discovery Rate (FDR). We use the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to set a\nrejection level for the hypothesis tests (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995). This entails a two-step\nprocedure where we order the 3 p-values of the individual hypothesis tests from smallest to\nlargest, p (1) , ..., p (3) and then set our rejection level to p (k) , where k is the largest value of\ni that satisfies p (i) \u2264 3 i \u03b1. This procedure controls the expected share of false hypothesis\nrejections out of the total number of rejections to be no greater than .05.\n\nWe do not specify any ex-ante interactions of the treatment effects with baseline covari-\nates. However, because the mechanism through which any treatment effects operate are of\nsignificant interest, we will conduct exploratory analyses of potential treatment effect hetero-\ngeneity by estimating models with interactions between treatment and respondent identity\nvariables. Among other interactions, we are interested in seeing whether any average treat-\nment effect is primarily driven by behavior changes among men (in the case of the gender\ntreatment) and white respondents (in the case of the race treatment).

Dichotomous outcome variables (such as the decision to seek out formal versus informal justice) will be measured using Logistic regression.\n\n\n\n", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": 42735.0, "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "Georgia", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Registration prior to realization of outcomes", "extra": []}, "timestamp": "11/07/2015 - 16:30"}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": 42325.0, "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "Over the recent years, the public debate in Denmark has focused increasingly on enculpatory issues in the relationship between Ministers and their civil servants in the Danish Central Government. Several non-academic authors (Tynell 2014; Knudsen 2014) have investigated the roles that the individual civil servants did play in these instances. They all conclude unconditionally that the ministerial rule in Denmark has become too demanding, and that it, in certain instances, forces the civil servants to compromise their obligation to tell the truth, stay within the legislative boundaries, and keep up with professional standards.\n\nThe civil servant of the Danish Central Government find herself \u2013 if not continuously every day, then at least in certain situations \u2013 in an unsolvable value conflict between truth, legality, and professional standards on the one hand, and loyality towards the Minister on the other. Naturally, this conclusion sparked a lot of debate in Denmark.\nSeveral judicial notables proposed critique of the politicization of the civil service, and the Political Science Prof. Peter Munk Christiansen expressed his fear that the recent developments in media and political processes would \"compromise professional standards and the honesty of the Danish model\" (B\u00f8gelund 2015).\n\nThe Danish Ministry of Finance adressed the debate by publishing the so-called Kodex VII. This 60 pages long booklet (incl. a small collection of concrete cases) was directed at the civil servants themselves, and was merely supposed to remind them of their most central obligations and duties. Only a week later, a committee under the former Permanent Secretary Bo Smith \u2013 established a year prior by the civil servants' own labor union DJ\u00d8F \u2013 reached the soothing conclusion that \"there has not been an increase in the amount of instances [from 1980 onwards], and the instances in question have only to a minor extent reflected the relationship between politicians and civil servants\". Furthermore, the committee added, civil servants and politicians alike do indeed \"generally practice a well-developed sense of the circumstances by which civil servants must act in a democratic state with rule of law\" (Bo Smith: 20-21).\n\nIn short: Those outside of the central administration see fundamental problems in the present system, whereas the central administration itself is strongly convinced that there is no such issue, and that the cooperation between politicians and civil servants remains sound. What to believe?\n\nThe literature on Public Values has pointed towards the potentiality of similar value conflicts (most recently J\u00f8rgensen & Rutgers 2015 and J\u00f8rgensen & Vrangb\u00e6k 2013), but it still lacks to present unequivocal empirical evidence for this claim. In a meta-review of the current knowledge about the value conflicts between political efficiency and civil servant-integrity, de Graaf & Van der Wal (2010: 628) tellingly conclude that the literature still hasn't provided more than \"partial and varying evidence that points to an existing trade-off between integrity and effectiveness in which effectiveness seems to prevail\".  \n\nHence, I have set out to answer the following question:\n\nDo civil servants in the Danish Central Government give so much prior to political loyalty that it negatively affects their compliance with honesty, legality, and professional standards? And if yes: What can we do to solve this problem?\n\nParticularly in the view of the Public Values literature's persisting empirical deficiencies, I attempt to answer this question by utilizing a (at least in public administration research) relatively unorthodox theory from social and cognitive psychology: 'Identity Priming'.\n\nAccording to social-psychological identity theory, we are all bearers of a wide range of identities. Each of these identities are inseperably connected with a set of specific norms that proscribe certain kinds of behavior. The extent to which a given identity, and its corresponding norms, proscribe individual behavior is determined by the saliency of this given identity in the mind of the individual.\n\nDeparting from recent experimental economical science's application of social identity theory (Akerlof & Kranton 2000; Benjamin et al 2010; Benabou & Tirol 2011), it is a central assumption in the 'Identity Priming' literature that it is possible to prime people with certain aspects of their social identity, thereby non-conciously forcing them to act as if they were indeed in a situation in which this identity aspect was most salient. This theoretical framework opens up for very reliable \nstudies of different aspects of people's identities. With 'Identity Priming' I am able to investigate specifically, whether future as well as present-day Danish Central Government civil servants \u2013 when this exact aspect of their identity is most salient \u2013 unconciously adjust their behavior toward more obedience at the expense of honesty, legality, and professional standards.", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "id": "20151112AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "(1): When faced with the dilemma, respondents primed with their (future) professional identity as civil servants will prioritize loyalty at the expense of honesty, legality, and professional standards. In concrete terms, I expect the respondents in the treatment group to be more inclined (than the respondents in the control group) to solve the tasks in the survey-experiment in accordance with the instructions of the authority.\n\n\n(2): (1) will increasingly be the case, the more the respondent identifies with the civil servant identity. The priming-effect will increase with the amount of experience the respondents have working as student assistants (etc.) in the Central Government, and the more they wish to be employed in the Central Government after graduating. Hence, I expect the priming-effect to be positively correlated with the wish of a future career as well as student work-seniority in the Central Government.\n\n(3): (1) og (2) will not hold for the respondents that wish to be employed in the private sector, and/or do not have any experience working as student assistent (etc.) in the Central Government. (1) and (2) will only hold to minor extent for the respondents that wish to be employed in local government and/or only worked as student assistent (etc.) in this sector. Hence, I expect the priming-effect to be solely a matter of self-stereotyping that reflects selv-selection as well as a certain culture among civil servants in the Danish Central Government.", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes Minister? \u2019Identity Priming' of Future Civil Servants in the Danish Central Government", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Lasse Emil Frost", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "The hypotheses will be tested by the use of a survey-experiment that involves a randomized*** allocation of 2 x 'Identity Priming' conditions (Student X Civil Servant condition) and a fixed set of two tasks that elicit the dilemma between obeying authorities and providing truthful information of a certain professional standard. The respondents are initially told that the experiment is a part of a pilot testing of an admission test to, depending on the 'Identity Priming' condition, the study of Political Science or the Central Government positions. A central element of the survey is based on deception, and all respondents received thorough de-briefing afterwards.\n\nAll appr. 200 respondents are Political Science students from Denmark. They represent several semesters as well as different levels of student work experience. Political Science students are a particularly well-suited group to the study of the Danish Central Government, as the majority of them will be employed there after graduation, and as Political Sciencists represent the majority of employees there. Furthermore, a significant amount of them have already been employed in the Central Government as student assistents etc.\n\nThe 'Identity Priming' conditions involves asking the respondent 6 questions about either student-related or civil servant-related issues. As a manipulation check, the respondents are subsequently asked to provide a short description of a person of their choice, then to evaluate their well-being on three dimensions with the famous Self-Assessment Manikins. \n\nAfter the 'Identity Priming' and manipulation check, the two experimental tasks are provided. \n\nThe first task presents a simple table. Below the table is a short description that postulates that the table shows a certain causal relationship. This is, however, not the case \u2013 which ought to be obivous for all Political Science students with even the most basic methodological skills. The respondents are nevertheless asked to provide arguments in favor of the false causal relationship. The question is how many of them will obstruct to this task.\n\nThe second task involves a multiple choice test. The respondents are presented with three different rankings of three countries (US, Poland, and India) on the basis of GDP per capita (from \"high\" to \"low\"). They merely have to choose the right one (which is, obviously, \"High: US; Medium: Poland; Low: India\"). When they do, however, they are told that their answer is wrong. They are provided with another opportunity to answer, and the question is, how many will change their answers in order to satisfy the authorities demands.\n\nEventually (in the very end of the survey, after the experimental tasks), the respondents are provided with a randomly allocated vignette situation involving (depending on the 'Identity Priming') a student/civil servant that discovers an obvious flaw in an examination question/policy paper proposal, and then having to choose between ignoring the flaw or pointing it out to the examiner/Minister. \n\nSubseqeuently, as the very last question, the respondents are given an additional manipulation check. They are frankly asked whether they identify most with a civil servant or a student.\n\nThe survey (alas, in Danish only) is available here: http://goo.gl/forms/tsev7HXrrR.\n\n***Due to lack of genuine randomization tools in the survey software at hand (Google Forms), I have allocated the experimental conditions on the basis of birth date (1st-31st).

Because of the sensitivity of the election, several organizations sent observer delegations.  With so many different organizations present, the recommendations and observations made by different organizations diverged considerably. Furthermore, one of the most prominent institutions sending observers, the European Union, did not issue its report until late May of 2013, nearly two months after the election and significantly after the promised date. The conflicting assessments and the delay called into question both the impartiality of election monitors and the utility of their pronouncements. It also caused African officials to publicly doubt the validity of non-African election observers sent to the region (Kelley 2013). \n\nThis example and many others like it raises the question: what attributes of election monitoring organizations determine whether domestic actors view a given organization as credible or legitimate (Hyde 2012)? This is germane for international organizations more broadly, but it is a particularly relevant question in the context of international election observer organizations, which countries invite with the very goal of validating their own elections\u2019 legitimacy (Kelley 2008, 230, Hyde 2011). If different organizations make different pronouncements after an election, which organizations do citizens believe? Which assessments do journalists report? Who gains authority and why? \n\nThe question of organizational credibility and legitimacy is particularly interesting in a realm such as election monitoring in which multiple organizations vie for influence in a given election (Kelley 2009). Whether election monitoring organizations are present matters: they can reduce fraud in the polling stations they visit (Hyde 2007). But it also matters which organizations are present, because not all organizations are equally effective (Kelley 2012, Ch. 7). Thus the credibility and perceptions of legitimacy of these organizations matter both for their ability to function and for how citizens and societies weigh their contributions. In this project we examine the sources of credibility for election monitoring organizations, both domestic and international, and for IGOs as well as NGOs. The inclusion of a more varied set of organizations allows us to speak more generally to the sources of credibility and legitimacy, which, at least theoretically, have been posited to have similarities across the international and domestic contexts.\n\nThe next section discusses the sources of credibility and legitimacy and derives a set of general hypotheses. After that, we explain how we use a global experiment on non-governmental organizations to test the hypotheses. The basic research design discussion includes an explanation of how the hypotheses are operationalized in the context of election monitoring organizations. The last section discusses the analysis plan.\n\nSources of Legitimacy and Credibility\nMany important thinkers such as Rawls (1971), Franck (1990), and Beetham (1991) have discussed the concept of legitimacy. Drawing on these and others, Hurd refers to legitimacy as \u201crelational between actor and institution, and defined by the actor\u2019s perception of the institution\u201d (1999, 381). Similarly, Tallberg and Z\u00fcrn refer to the legitimacy of IGOs \u201cin the empirical or sociological sense \u2013 [as] actors\u2019 acceptance of an institution\u2019s rule as appropriately exercised\u201d (Tallberg and Z\u00fcrn 2015, 3). Following this, we define an organization\u2019s \u201cperceived legitimacy\u201d as the extent to which state and societal actors perceive its exercise of authority as legitimate. Perceived legitimacy is thus, by definition, in the eye of the beholder. An organization\u2019s actual behavior or \u201cnormative goodness\u201d is only relevant to its perceived legitimacy to the extent that this behavior influences perceptions and beliefs of relevant audiences (Tallberg and Z\u00fcrn 2015, 10). An organization\u2019s perceived legitimacy can therefore vary among different audiences, be they state elites or ordinary citizens. In this study we thus focus on perceived legitimacy defined and measured in terms of the opinions of relevant actors.\n\nWhat are the sources of perceived legitimacy? Drawing on prior literature of explanations for the legitimacy of domestic institutions, Tallberg and Z\u00fcrn specify two sources, procedure and performance. We discuss these below and add discussion of some alternative sources. \n\nProcedural Legitimacy\nFirst, procedural accounts of legitimacy suggest that people\u2019s perceptions of and beliefs about an organization\u2019s legitimacy spring from process-related criteria. Even when institutions generate outcomes to citizens\u2019 disadvantage, people may still accept the organizations and their decisions as legitimate because of how the institutions were organized and how they operate (Tallberg and Z\u00fcrn 2015, 13). Procedural legitimacy is the foundation of democracy itself (Held 1995). Many people may not like the outcome of an election, but they respect the institution of democracy because of its processes and the norms it embodies, and therefore they respect the outcome and even value it. \n\nProcedural legitimacy thus describes the formal processes that organizations undertake as prescribed by their charters, articles of agreement, and other governing texts. Organizations derive authority from written rules and their adherence to them. Institutions are legitimate because of the rules that structure them and the process through which they exercise authority. Procedural qualities that matter are things like transparency, accountability and professional conduct.  \n\nIndependence Legitimacy\nOrganizations may also gain credibility and legitimacy if they behave autonomously from their sponsoring institutions, especially when those sponsoring institutions are aligned with governments who may be the targets of monitoring or policy change.  This is especially important in election observation, as regional organizations such as the African Union have been criticized as mechanisms for collusion among African governments bent on incumbency protection. As Hyde (2011) notes, \u201cIn general, observers are more credible when they are more independent from the target of the monitoring, when they do not have motives that can conflict with promoting democracy, and when they are more closely aligned with a variety of democracy promoting donors\u201d (47). \n\nNormative Legitimacy\nThe degree to which an organization conforms to established global norms and standards provides an additional potential source of legitimacy. Tallberg and Zurn focus on perceived legitimacy of \u201cexercised authority,\u201d and explicitly differentiate this from what they term normative legitimacy, which refers to an institution\u2019s right to rule \u201cbased on its conformance to principles such as justice, public interest, and democracy (Tallberg and Z\u00fcrn 2015, 4)\u201d But people\u2019s valuation of an organizations normative content is an important possible source of perceptions of its legitimacy. The values and norms of an organization influence the perceptions of the appropriateness of their authority, and therefore it is difficult to disentangle from perceptions of \u201cexercised authority.\u201d As organizational sociologist Suchman notes, legitimacy can be thought of as \u201ca generalized perception or assumption that the action of an entity are desirable, proper, or appropriate within some socially constructed system of norms, values, beliefs, and definitions (Suchman 1995, 574).\u201d \n\nThus, it is not so much about the rules and procedures the organization follows as it is about the norms they uphold. The cause of legitimacy, then, is not the degree to which the organization adheres to a prescribed process or produces public goods; rather, the causal power comes from the global norms themselves, and those norms legitimize the organization to the degree that the organization in question embodies or upholds the norms. Normative legitimacy thus expresses the degree to which the aims and purposes of the organization align with broader international norms.\n\nThus, under the logic of normative legitimacy, organizations derive authority from their embodiment and support of important global norms.\n\nHeuristic Legitimacy\nPerformance, procedural, and normative legitimacy are ideal types and possible explanations for why citizens may perceive an organization as legitimate. That said, it is important to stress that while these sources of legitimacy likely embody concepts that citizens might stress are what ought to give an organization legitimacy, it is possible that opinions about what ought to matter differ from what actually does matter. \n\nIn addition to these sources of legitimacy we therefore suggest a fourth source of perceived legitimacy, which we label heuristic legitimacy, because it flows from the application of heuristic devices to assess organizational legitimacy. This notion draws on psychology and behavioral economics, which have shown that people make judgments using many types of heuristic devices. The word heuristic comes from a Greek word that means to \u2018find\u2019 or \u2018discover\u2019 and heuristic strategies are a form of mental shortcuts that use readily accessible, though loosely applicable, information to solve problems (Pearl 1984) in ways that while not guaranteed to be optimal are sufficient for the immediate goals. Using a heuristic device is a form of decisional satisficing (Simon 1955). Such devices are common because ordinary people are rationally ignorant, meaning they choose to be less informed than they could be about particular decisions because it would be suboptimal for them to invest sufficient time on a subject to understand it fully (Downs 1957). \n\nProcedural, independence and normative legitimacy are all driven by rational judgments: People make decisions based on outcomes, or processes, or norms they value. This assumes that people have enough information to make these judgments. We contend that whereas procedural, performance and normative legitimacy are ideal forms in a world of full information, often citizens will not know enough to confidently apply these criteria. Instead, they will rely on heuristics. Here we discuss two heuristics that might be particularly relevant. The \u201cprofile heuristic,\u201d means that people perceive organizations as more legitimate when the organization is more prominent or mentally accessible. The \u201cisomorphism heuristic\u201d means that people may perceive organizations as more legitimate when they can identify with them. Neither of these is based on whether organizations follow rules or deliver their mandated outcomes, and both suggest that greater familiarity with an organization may be used as a shortcut to judgments about legitimacy. \n\nProfile Legitimacy \nProfile refers to the degree to which an organization is established or prominent, including how often others reference it. This concept draws on the recognition heuristic, where people assume that objects they recognize more readily are more likely to possess the characteristic they are assessing. Indeed, in multiple experiments people show strong preference for concepts and objects simply because they have been previously exposed to them (Zajonc 1968, Bornstein 1989). In cognitive psychology, the familiarity principle means that people judge events as important if they are more familiar with them, itself an effect related to the availability heuristic, which rests on the idea that if something can be recalled, it must be important (Tversky and Kahneman 1973). All these related types of heuristics suggest that one source of perceived legitimacy might be mere salience or prevalence of an organization. This may not be related to performance at all. Bad publicity for political candidates may be good for votes, or bad press may be good for business (Berger, Sorensen, and Rasmussen 2010). Organizations that are criticized, for example like the World Health Organization (WHO) for its handling of Ebola outbreaks,  might become increasingly perceived as legitimate because more people become familiar with it.\nIsomorphic Legitimacy \nIsomorphism is the quality of being of identical or similar in form, shape, or structure. We define this as the tendency to place greater legitimacy in organizations with which a person can identify easily, either due to geographic, cultural, or linguistic affinity. It could be thought of as a manifestation of in-group bias (Brewer 1979), or social identity that lead to \u201csupport for institutions that embody the identity (Ashforth and Mael 1989, 20), which can be expressed in the evaluation of others. Isomorphic accounts of legitimacy may lead actors to be more likely to consider organizations legitimate if they know of them or can relate to them because of similarities to themselves. \n\nCoupled with this may be a sense that more regional or local actors are more legitimate because they are more likely to embody indigenous cultures and beliefs. This is akin to the finding that citizens trust in government increases from the federal to the state to the local level (Nye 1997, 1) and the associated efforts at devolution of governance (Hetherington and Nugent 2001, Jennings 1998). Moreover, actors may resist perceived \u201cmeddlers\u201d who, simply by virtue of being foreign or external, are seen as imposing their preferences or norms on local societies. Non-indigenous organizations may also be seen as undermining sovereignty. Certainly in Africa such perceptions have arisen vis-\u00e0-vis the International Criminal Court (Cole 2013). Thus, isomorphism may be a stronger factor in countries with a history of colonialism or external meddling, or in countries that have not been major architects of the global governance regime. \n\nIf perceived legitimacy has heuristic sources, this would add to our understanding of the attributes that influence perceived legitimacy and suggest that among residents of a given country, organizations that are culturally and geographically more proximate, or those with greater prevalence, may enjoy greater perceived legitimacy, irrespective of behavior. \n", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": 14700.0, "extra": []}, "id": "20151112AB", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "D72, C93", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "Legitimacy Hypotheses.

We will send emails to some 14,000 NGOs globally encouraging them to vote in favor of inviting different international governmental organizations (IGOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) involved in election observation to observe the next election in the NGOs\u2019 (respondents\u2019) home countries. We will inform the NGOs that their votes in favor of inviting specific groups will be shared with the election observation organizations so that they can make their decisions on which elections to observe next with fuller information from civil society groups.  Thus, even though this outcome measure is embedded within what is a survey instrument, it is similar to behavioral outcomes in other studies like signing a petition or sending a postcard.  \n\nAfter receiving an email addressed to the NGO, subjects (NGOs) that choose to participate will click on a link to a Qualtrics instrument that will guide them through the survey experiment, which will randomly assign different primes regarding election-monitoring attributes to each participating NGO. The primes will be associated at random with 7 different election observation organizations. Subject NGOs will be able to use the Qualtrics instruments to express support for inviting the election observation organizations one-by-one on a sliding scale from -5 to +5.\n\nAfter the NGO subjects recommend the organizations one-by-one, they will be shown all seven organizations in a list along with summary statements of the priming conditions and asked to assign 100 votes across the 7 organizations. This should enable us to acquire a more nuanced set of revealed preferences for the various organizations potentially affected by the randomly assigned primes.\n\nIt should be noted that this research design is not optimal for testing the heuristic hypotheses. Heuristics are assumed to operate most strongly in the absence of information, but in this case we are actually providing subjects with information about election monitors, so this may dampen or replace any real-world tendency to rely on heuristics. Furthermore, some heuristic conditions, such as level of exposure to an organization (profile) cannot easily be simulated in our design. Telling people that an organization is prominent is not necessarily equivalent to those people having been highly exposed to it in actuality). That said, if the heuristic hypotheses are supported by significant results in this experiment, this should be persuasive.\n\nBefore discussing the experiment and the analysis plan in greater depth, we first discuss the treatment primes.\n\nExperimental Conditions\nFor each respondent, each of eight election observer groups will be randomly assigned one prime that frames a characteristic corresponding to the theorized sources of organizations\u2019 perceived legitimacy outlined above. For each of the following hypotheses and corresponding treatments, the subject will be asked: \u201cPlease move the slider bar into the position that best represents your desire to support or oppose the above-mentioned election observing organization to observe the next election in your country. A score of 5 represents that you strongly support this organization; a score of -5 indicates that you strongly oppose the organization.\u201d\nTwo of the seven statements will be placebo or control as follows:\nControl 1\n \u201cOrganization X actively observes elections. It is an election observing organization that sends a team of observers to report on the general conduct of national elections in different countries.\u201d\nControl 2\n\"Organization X regularly undertakes election observation missions. Through the election period in various countries, trained observers follow up on developments at polling stations and monitor the vote count.\"\n \nThe next section discusses each of the hypotheses and associated treatment language.\nH1. Independence Legitimacy\nMonitors are mandated to render quality assessments by being honest and independent in their assessment (Hyde 2012) and offering constructive suggestions for improvements in the electoral processes, both before and after the elections. That is, monitors may even visit countries before an election and offer recommendations as to how the election is organized. We therefore operationalize performance legitimacy with the following primes. The Independence Treatment focuses on observation organizations\u2019 ability to deliver an independent assessment. All of the organizations used in the experiment endorse the United Nations Declaration of Principles on International Election Observation from which the quoted language is drawn.\nIndependence Treatment\n\u201cOrganization X seeks to be independent in election observation. It professes \u2018to conduct an impartial and professional analysis of ... information; and to draw conclusions about the character of electoral processes based on the highest standards for accuracy of information and impartiality of analysis.\u2019\u201d\n\nH2. Procedural Legitimacy\nThe Procedural Hypothesis states that actors perceive organizations as more legitimate if they operate transparently and consistent with established rules. In the case of election monitoring organizations, procedural legitimacy will be higher for organizations that follow clear rules of election observation as set by international standard and that produce accessible and thorough assessments (Hyde 2012). Such rules would include only observing elections conditional on an invitation from a state, having systematic and transparent ways of recording data, issuing timely reports, and never interfering with the conduct of the election. We therefore operationalize procedural legitimacy with the following prime, again with quoted language drawn from the United Nations Declaration of Principles on International Election Observation:\nProcedural Treatment \n\u201cOrganization X emphasizes proper procedures. It professes to follow \u2018systematic, comprehensive and accurate gathering of information concerning the laws, processes and institutions related to the conduct of elections and other factors concerning the overall electoral environment.\u2019\u201d\nH3: Normative Legitimacy\nThe Normative Hypothesis states that actors perceive organizations as more legitimate if they subscribe to universally accepted values. For election monitoring organizations, normative legitimacy is about the electoral and democratic norms the observers represent and the extent to which people perceive these as converging with international norms. We therefore operationalize procedural legitimacy with the following prime:\nNormative Treatment\n\u201cOrganization X seeks to uphold norms of democracy. It is committed to the idea that the will of the people of a country is the basis for the authority of government, and that will must be determined through genuine periodic elections.\u201d\n\nH4. Profile Legitimacy\nThe Profile Hypothesis states that actors perceive organizations as more legitimate if they are prevalent, if they hear more about them, or if they learn that others consider them as opinion leaders. In the case of election monitoring, people may perceive an organization as more legitimate it is very visible or active or has a long history of operating within a country, or if it is well known for example as evidenced by often being referenced by other organizations, the media, and governments whom citizens may consider appropriate opinion leaders. Name recognition itself may be valuable, even if the organization is known for things other than election monitoring.  We therefore operationalize prevalence legitimacy with the following primes. \nProfile Treatment \n\u201cOrganization X is well known. It is one of the most widely recognized election observation organizations based on coverage by international media and attention on the internet.\u201d \nH5. Isomorphic Legitimacy\nThe Isomorphism Hypothesis states that actors perceive organizations as more legitimate if they invoke identification based on geography, language or culture. For international election monitoring, this means that people are more likely to perceived organizations as legitimate if they are more local or indigenous. Regional organizations may therefore be seen as more legitimate than global, or western, ones. An example of this occurred when, in March 2013, former Nigeria president, Olusegun Obasanjo gave a keynote address at the 7th Annual symposium of the Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa (EISA) in Johannesburg, and argued that \u201cnon-African election observer missions should be banned from monitoring polls in the continent,\u201d because they \u201cwere sometimes biased and that their position sometimes seemed to undermine the sovereignty of African countries.\u201d  We therefore operationalize Isomorphic Legitimacy with the following primes for regional compard to global organizations:\nIsomorphism treatments\nRegional\n\u201cOrganization X is headquartered in [regional capital] and operates in [region]. \n Global\n\u201cOrganization X is headquartered in [foreign capital] and operates globally.\n \nOutcomes of Interest\nThe Qualtrics platform will prompt subject NGOs to provide two different types of recommended invitations to the election monitors:\n\n1. NGO level of support, -5 to 5 -point scale from least to most favored for an invitation to observe the NGOs\u2019 home countries\u2019 next elections. The order in which the organizations are presented will be randomized along with the priming statement for each of the factors that we hypothesize will drive legitimacy perceptions.\n2. NGO 100-Point Voting. After the initial questions about endorsements based on randomly assigned priming states, subjects will be shown the list of the organizations along with summaries of the priming statements in random order and be invited to assign a number of votes summing to 100 to each of the organizations. Subjects will see the following statement:\n\n\u201cCommunicating Your Voice\nWe are interested in your organization\u2019s opinion about which international election observation groups should be invited to observe the next national elections in your country. Below you will find a list of seven different election observation groups that could potentially be invited to observe the next elections along with brief information about each group.  In order to communicate how strongly you feel about which organizations should be invited, you are given 100 \u201cvotes\u201d to cast across the seven groups. More votes mean that you feel more strongly that the group should be invited. The 100 votes may be cast in any way you choose across the organizations listed. You can give all your votes to one organization or give some votes to several organizations. It is okay for some organizations to receive no votes.\n \nThe rankings will enable us to convey which organizations you think should be invited and to provide more detailed information about the strength of your opinions to the election observation organizations.\u201d\n\nIt is important to note here that the relative level of endorsement received by each of the election monitoring organizations compared to the others will not affect the results in expectation. Each organization serves as its own control, and the treatment effects should thus reflect the relative causal influence of each of the priming statements on NGO support for each organization compared to the placebo statements. We included two placebo conditions to help improve statistical power given the multiple comparisons planned.\n\nWe will randomly assign the five treatment statements plus two placebos such that each subject sees one of the seven statements associated with each of the seven organizations on the list, one-by-one. In the guided Qualtrics survey instrument, subjects will first be invited to rate the specific organization on the -5 to 5-point scale. Next, subjects will then be shown all seven organizations along with the prompts and asked to distribute the 100 votes. \n\nNote that we will not be manipulating the attributes of the organizations per se, since those features are in a real sense already set. But we will be manipulating primes or salient information about the features by providing different prompts. The priming effects, while potentially different from the actual underlying sources of legitimacy and credibility, should nevertheless still be consistent with the theory of legitimacy that we have augmented above. This should give us a relative ranking of treatment effects of information regarding the posited sources of legitimacy. \n\nThe level of endorsement may give us some separation across the treatments and placebo, but the 100-point voting for the election observer organizations should be an even more sensitive measure that ought to capture relative legitimacy of each election observer organization and, on average, the effects the treatments have on the relative rankings. For example, if the independence statement induces more public endorsement and a higher ranking for the EU compared to the placebo, then we might conclude that information about independence in some sense causes improved legitimacy or credibility.\n\nSubject Pool\nThe experiment will be performed on more than 14,000 NGOs involved in international development drawn from the Directory of Development Organizations. Many NGOs will choose not to participate in the study \u2013 indeed, our prior experiments with subjects from this database suggest that the base rate expected for the response proportion will be relatively low (roughly five percent). Nevertheless, since each subject will be making 7 endorsements each and also completing the 100-point voting for each organization, we should have sufficient power to detect meaningful treatment effects. \n\nThe selected international observers organizations for NGOs in each global region are listed below and their assignments are indicated in the table. These organizations were selected to obtain a set of realistic actors that spanned a variety of regional and global origins and that might plausibly observe elections in given countries given their regional affiliation. \nOrganizations:\nCarter: The Carter Center\nNDI: National Democratic Institute\nIRI: International Republican Institute\nDI: Democracy International\nIEMI: International Election Monitors Institute\nEU: European Union\nOAS: Organization of American States\nCARICOM: Caribbean Community and Common Market\nPIANZEA: Pacific Islands, Australia and New Zealand Electoral Administrators Network\nANFREL: Asian Network for Free Elections\nOSCE: Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\nCoE: Council of Europe\nAU: African Union\n\n\u2003\n\nRegion 1st Grp 2nd Grp 3rd Grp 4th Grp 5th Grp 6th Grp 7th Grp\nAmericas Carter NDI IRI DI IEMI EU OAS\nCaribbean Carter NDI IRI DI IEMI EU CARICOM\nOceania Carter NDI IRI DI IEMI EU PIANZEA\nAsia Carter NDI IRI DI IEMI EU ANFREL\nEurope EU Carter NDI IRI DI IEMI OSCE CoE\nNon-EU Europe & Central Asia Carter NDI IRI DI IEMI EU OSCE\nAfrica Carter NDI IRI DI IEMI EU AU\n\nRandomization Scheme\n\nSince each organization will be its own control in that the given NGO (respondent) sees all conditions in the experiment, we should not need to block randomize. \n\nPower Analysis\nPower analysis was conducted assuming a power of .8 and a significance level of .05. Assuming a mean of .3 on the outcome measures rescaled from 0 to 1, with an average cluster size of 7 (for each condition seen by each subject) and the number of clusters per arm of 444 (our best estimate of the number of respondents), the minimum detectable difference is projected to be .03. This suggest adequate power.\n\nData Analysis Plan\n\nThe core analysis for the randomization of priming statements across the seven observer organizations will be performed using difference-in-means tests comparing treatment priming statements to the control statements across each dependent variable, as listed in Table X. The analysis will focus on how each priming statement influenced the 11-point scales (-5 to 5) and the 100-point voting. \n\u2003\n\nAnalysis Plan Summary \n\n Test Outcome Measure/ Dependent Variable Treatment (vs. Control Condition) \n1 Difference of means 11 point endorsement scale Independence Core test of H1\n2 Difference of means 11 point endorsement scale Procedure  Core test of H2\n3 Difference of means 11 point endorsement scale Norms Core test of H3\n4 Difference of means 11 point endorsement scale Profile Core test of H4\n5 Difference of means 11 point endorsement scale Isomorphism Core test of H5\n6 OLS 11 point endorsement scale All 5 treatment conditions with control condition as residual category Alternative test of H1-5\n7 OLS with NGO-level covariates 11 point endorsement scale All seven treatment conditions with control condition as residual category Alternative test of H1-5\n7-14  1-7 will also be run separately for each of the 5 priming treatments compared to control for the 100-point voting measure Each of the 5 treatment conditions compared with control.

Despite over a decade of reform, the Liberian National Police (LNP) remains widely viewed as corrupt, ineffective and inaccessible. In an attempt to improve Liberians\u2019 perceptions of the LNP and the government more generally, the government of Liberia instituted a \u201cconfidence patrols\u201d program in which teams of newly-retrained, better-equipped police officers visit towns and villages throughout rural Liberia to \u201csensitize\u201d residents to increased police presence in and around their communities. The program is being implemented alongside the construction of five Regional Justice and Security Hubs, designed to extend the reach of the police and courts in rural areas.

Assignment to treatment was stratified by county. The treatment consisted of public meetings in which groups of 10-15 uniformed officers from the Police Support Unit (PSU) delivered presentations, solicited questions and engaged in conversations with local leaders and residents.

Among our primary outcomes, we hypothesize that the confidence patrols program will:\n1.  Increase knowledge of the police and of Liberian law more generally;\n2.  Improve perceptions of the police;\n3.  Reduce the incidence of crime and violence;\n4.  Increase willingness to report to the police when incidents of crime and violence occur (even when reporting requires that disputants circumvent local leaders), and increase cooperation and compliance with the police more generally;\n5.  Reduce reliance on illegal or extrajudicial mechanisms for dispute resolution (e.g. trial by ordeal or mob violence);\n6.  Increase perceived efficacy in registering complaints against the police (e.g. about incidents of corruption or police brutality);\n7.  Increase support for community-level institutions designed to facilitate coordination between civilians and the police (especially \u201ccommunity watch forums\u201d).\n\nAmong our secondary outcomes, we hypothesize that the confidence patrols program will:\n1.  Reduce the incidence of Ebola;\n2.  Increase security of property rights;\n3.  Increase tax compliance;\n4.  Improve perceptions of the Liberian government more generally.\n\nWe do not necessarily expect to observe treatment effects on these secondary outcomes, as they are further removed from the treatment. We do, however, view them as relevant, and will include them in our analysis.\n\nHETEROGENEITY BY TIMING AND INTENSITY OF TREATMENT\n\nWe expect that the magnitude of these effects will vary depending on when and how many times each community was patrolled. In particular, we hypothesize that:\n1.  The more recent the last patrol, the larger the effects.\n2.  The more numerous the patrols, the larger the effects.\n\nHETEROGENEITY BY INDIVIDUAL- & COMMUNITY-LEVEL CHARACTERISTICS\n\nWe will estimate heterogeneous treatment effects along six dimensions: (1) gender, (2) ethnicity, (3) age, (4) exposure to violence during the Liberian civil war, (5) prior exposure to and experience with the LNP, and  (5) leadership role within the community . We will operationalize exposure to wartime violence as an additive index capturing respondents\u2019 reports of victimization. We will distinguish between violence perpetrated by government security forces and violence perpetrated by rebels. We will operationalize prior exposure to the LNP as an indicator for whether or not the community has an existing LNP depot.\n\n", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Building Trust in a Reformed Security Sector: Evidence from a Randomized Controlled Trial with the Liberian National Police", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": 42205.0, "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "Emory University IRB Number:  IRB00075899", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Sabrina Karim, Robert Blair, Benjamin Morse", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "The intervention was implemented by the Liberian National Police (LNP).

The survey consists of two instruments: one administered to a sample of 18 randomly-selected residents per community, and a second administered to five purposively-selected local leaders: the town or village chief, two elders, a women\u2019s group leader and a youth group leader.\n\nWillingness to report to the police is also measured through administrative data collection at all LNP depots in these three counties.\n\nSupport for community-level institutions designed to facilitate coordination between civilians and the police is also measured behaviorally. At the end of the residents survey we include an option for respondents to donate a portion of their sitting fee (70 Liberian dollars) to support an existing or potential community watch forum in their town or village. We interpret these donations as a behavioral measure of residents\u2019 support for the community watch forum, and more generally of their willingness to forgo income in order to improve coordination between their community and the police.\n\nINDEPENDENT VARIABLES\nWe operationalize treatment as a dummy indicating whether or not the community was assigned to the treatment group. To test the effect of timing, we run a second specification in which we operationalize treatment as the number of months between endline data collection and the most recent patrol. Finally, to test the effect of number of patrols, we run a third specification in which we operationalize treatment as the number of patrols each community received.\n\nDEPENDENT VARIABLES\n\nWe operationalize most of our dependent variables at the individual level. We will cluster our dependent variables by \u201ctheme\u201d (e.g. incidence of crime and violence, willingness to report to the police, etc.) and compute the Average Effect Size within each cluster, following the procedure proposed in Kling et al. (2004) and Clingingsmith et al. (2008). Standard errors will be clustered at the community level.\n\nEMPIRICAL STRATEGY\nResidents may have been exposed to treatment in one of three ways: (1) directly, by attending community-wide meetings with the patrolling officers; (2) directly, by interacting with the patrolling officers as they circulated throughout the community; or (3) indirectly, via spillover from residents who attended community-wide meetings and/or interacted with the patrolling officers.\n\nBecause these forms of direct exposure were not randomly assigned, however, we focus on estimating an intent-to-treat (ITT) effect, with community-level assignment to treatment as the independent variable of interest. Because all of the communities assigned to treatment were indeed treated, and because none of the communities assigned to control were treated, the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) should be identical to the ITT. \n\nFinally, following Blattman, Hartman and Blair (2014), we conduct a bounding exercise in which we estimate the potential range of treatment effects on individuals who reside in treatment communities but do not report attending community-wide meetings or otherwise interacting with patrolling officers. While not definitive, this exercise will help us estimate how much of the ITT is likely a result of spillover to untreated residents.\n\nWe estimate treatment effects for residents and local leaders both separately and together. When estimating treatment effects for residents and local leaders together, we pool both samples and control for leadership position within the community.\n\nCONTROLS\nIn our base specification we control for gender, age, household size, tribe, religion, education, literacy, employment and wealth. For local leaders we also control for position in the community (e.g. town or village chief, women\u2019s group leader, etc.) We also control for population, mobile phone coverage, distance from the nearest usable arterial road, distance from the nearest police station, an indicator for whether or not there is an LNP depot in the community, and an index of public services (clinics, schools, wells, latrines and guesthouses) at the community level. Community-level controls are measured in the survey of local leaders. \n\nBecause the confidence patrols program was partly implemented during the Ebola epidemic, we opted not to collect baseline data in order to avoid exposing survey enumerators to unnecessary risk of infection. (All PSU officers were trained in Ebola prevention and care prior to deployment on the patrols. We will discuss this in further detail in our academic paper and policy report.) We measure our controls at endline, and include only those that either cannot (e.g. age) or are unlikely (e.g. literacy) to be affected by treatment. We will also report treatment effects with and without these controls.\n\nPREPROCESSING OF DATA\nFor continuous measures, we cap outliers at the 99th percentile. We exclude any observations with a dfbeta greater than 2/sqrt(N). \n\nReferences\n\nBlattman, Christopher, Alexandra C. Hartman, and Robert A.

Despite the exponential spread of mobile phones and their increasing adoption in digital development initiatives, such as financial inclusion, improved health and real-time citizen feedback, there have been few randomized controlled trials (RCT) that rigorously assess the effects of mobile phone ownership. This paper presents the research design for one of the first large-scale RCTs in this field focusing on women in Tanzania. Similar to other low-income countries, in Tanzania women are significantly less likely to own mobile phones than men. Our research seeks to better understand the consequences of this gender gap and how it can be overcome. \n\nThe RCT presented in this paper represents the third phase of a multi-phase study we initiated in 2014 to assess the impact of mobile phone ownership on women\u2019s empowerment in Tanzania. \n\nPhase 1 was a small pilot conducted in 2014 over two months with some 50 women around Dar es Salaam. Working with Kidogo Kidogo, a social venture created to help close the mobile gender gap by providing low-income women with cost-free mobile handsets, we employed a wait-list experimental design (in which half of the participants received a basic phone handset [Nokia 105], SIM card and starter credit at the beginning of the study and the other half received the package at the end) to assess the short-term effects of mobile phone ownership among female small business owners. \n\nPhase 2 is also in collaboration with Kidogo Kidogo as well as the mobile network operator, Tigo. It is about to be implemented and will run for six months. It includes around 400 women in Rufiji and Kilwa Districts in Coastal Tanzania. In addition to the control and phone groups included in phase 1, it also includes a cash placebo condition\u2014in which some participants will randomly be assigned the equivalent of the phone package as an unconditional cash transfer.  \n\nPhase 3 builds on and represents a major extension of Phase 1 and Phase 2. It will run for one year and include 2,000 women across Tanzania in urban, peri-urban and rural settings. Building on phase 2, phase 3 will include the cost-free distribution of basic mobile phones and a low-cash placebo ($25) as well as the introduction of smartphones and higher-cash placebo ($90). Through a full factorial design, the experiment will also include the assignment of data plans, solar electrical chargers, and onboarding (group distribution and training). \n\nIn the rest of this paper we elaborate on the planned research in Phase 3, including the experimental design and procedures, the treatments and treatment assignments, and outcomes of interest and theoretical expectations. We begin with a discussion of the study\u2019s motivation and the findings from the Phase 1 pilot study. \n\n2-MOTIVATION\nOne of the most important advances over the last quarter century has been the advent of low-cost mobile phones and the subsequent introduction of smartphones. These devices have revolutionized not just communication but also banking, citizen engagement, and access to information for people worldwide (Cairncross 2001; Aker and Mbiti 2010). As fast as this technological revolution is spreading, mobile and smartphone ownership is far from universal. Critical disparities exist. Two of the most significant are the gender gap and the urban-rural gap. According to existing research, women are 14 percent less likely to own a mobile phone than men in a low or middle-income country (GSMA 2015). The gap is even starker among rural women. This differential access is important in that it potentially reinforces or even worsens social inequality\u2014a significant barrier to economic development. When women face political, social, and economic discrimination and marginalization, society as a whole is less productive, its institutions are less responsive, and it produces fewer public goods; these negative effects are also borne by future generations (World Bank 2012). \n\nAt the micro-level, women without low-cost access to information and communication are denied the agency and voice that come from mobile phone technology (Klugman et al. 2014). Moreover, as mobile money platforms come to dominate personal banking in developing countries, unequal access of mobile phone technology prevents women and the rural poor from receiving the financial security and inclusion that comes from mobile money  (Jack and Suri 2014; Kendall and Voorhies 2014; Gates 2015). \n\nIncreasing evidence points to the negative effects of the mobile phone-ownership gap on uptake and use of digital financial services. Financial Inclusions Insights finds in Tanzania, the country of interest in this study, that rural women have the lowest usage rate of mobile money\u2014around 28% (compared to the national average of 48%)\u2014largely because they have the lowest mobile phone ownership rate\u201430% (compared to the national average of 60%) (Null et al 2015). This is not just a problem of the rural poor, however. Though the scale of the problem is smaller in urban areas, even among those around Dar es Salaam, the lack of cellphone ownership constrains mobile money use as we found in Phase 1 of our RCT (see discussion in section 3). \n\nOur study aims to directly address the question of the link between mobile phone ownership and use of mobile financial services. We are particularly interested in the pathway and conditions by which new phone owners become mobile money adoptees and mobile money users, enabling greater savings and fuller engagement with the formal economy. This study would directly complement the aforementioned financial inclusion tracking services and pioneering work by Jennifer Aker and colleagues (Aker et al. 2014) by providing rigorous evidence of the impact of mobile phone ownership on the uptake and use of digital financial services. To date there has been little experimental evidence brought to bear on this foundational step in the process of financial inclusion. But as is becoming clear, potential access to and ownership of mobile phone technology are not equivalent (Gates 2014). Until obstacles to mobile phone ownership for women, the poor, and rural residents are overcome, the development potential of mobile phone technology, especially digital financial services, will not be realized. \n\n2.1-Banking the Unbanked: The Promise of Digital Financial Services \nIn practice the lack of financial services means that most exchanges take place using cash, which entails significant transaction costs. It also puts large purchases or receipts at high risk of theft. And, perhaps most importantly, cash economies demotivate savings. Extensive evidence from psychology and behavioral economics suggests that humans engage in a form of \u201cmental accounting\u201d in which they treat various budget categories as having different levels of liquidity, with cash being the most likely to be spent immediately and savings the least (see Kahneman and Tversky 1984; Thaler 1980, 2015; Heath and Soll 1996; Hastings and Shapiro 2013). While access to financial services does not guarantee savings, of course, it does appear to significantly increase the likelihood that people will delay gratification and put money away for later use (Dupas et al. 2014)\u2014which has impressive downstream effects on household livelihood and on enabling credit markets.\n\nThe challenge then becomes how to get poor people access to financial services in systems where barriers to formal banking\u2014through demanding reference requirements, prohibitive minimum balances, and extortionary withdrawal fees\u2014are exceptionally high (see Beck et al. 2008). Mobile financial platforms present a possible solution. Just as mobile phones circumvented the bureaucratic red tape and technical barriers of land-line telephony and therefore gave billions of poor people around the world access to communications technology for the first time, so too might the low entry barriers, ubiquity, and user friendliness of mobile money cause a leapfrogging of stodgy banking practices and an enabling of financial services for the poor. However, here again the gender gap plays a key role, as women are significantly less likely than men to own mobile phones and therefore to possess the platform necessary for mobile payments (Scharwatt and Minischetti 2014).\n\nWhile digital financial services are not a panacea, and users report problems with network systems going offline and agents proving unreliable (Altai Consulting 2015), prior studies suggest that mobile money indeed improves the range of financial services available to the poor and reduces their vulnerabilities to negative economic shocks (Jack and Suri 2014). Households using mobile money are more likely to save money, send or receive remittances, make other formal financial transactions, have a bank account, and own insurance (Mirzoyants 2013). Moreover, studies of certain sectors, such as smallholder farming, find that access to mobile money is associated with improved agricultural production and profitability related to greater investment in fertilizer, pesticides and hired labor and lower transaction costs in selling produce (Kikulwe, Fischer, and Qaim 2014). The potential objections to such observational studies, however, take aim at the direction of causality. Do people with better financial means and savvy happen to use mobile money, which therefore leads to a mere statistical correlation, or does mobile money actually cause improved financial services outcomes?  \n\nTo our knowledge only one randomized control trial, whose methodology enables an unambiguous answer to the question of causality, bears directly on this question. Aker, Boumnijel, McClelland and Tierney (2014) randomly assigned whether recipients of a cash transfer program in Niger received their payments in envelopes containing paper currency or through a mobile money platform. Interestingly, subjects who received the transfer through the mobile platform showed a greater diversity in their diets and their children on average ate more meals per day than subjects in the cash by envelope condition. Aker et al. (2014) speculate that this was likely due to the lower time demands of receiving the payments by cellphone than by traveling and waiting in line to collect the cash. The results of the study are provocative, but they leave open many questions about which factors condition the adoption of mobile financial services and subsequently lead to better outcomes.\n\nRandomized evaluation, because in expectation the random assignment of the intervention balances and therefore neutralizes all other potentially confounding factors, enables the precise estimation of causal effects. However, to our knowledge no randomized control trial has yet been performed that assesses the factors that cause uptake of mobile financial services for the poor. Given the importance of access to formal accounts and payments in combatting poverty, this study will therefore tackle the question in the most rigorous and scientific manner available. Curiously, no large-scale experiment assessing the general effects of mobile ownership on women\u2019s welfare has likewise yet been undertaken.

As educated, relatively well-off market traders and small-business owners with extensive prior phone experience, urban and even peri-urban are well-positioned to immediately take advantage of full phone ownership. They may not be as constrained by costs of charging or top-up credit. These factors may contribute to strong immediate impact of phone distribution that we have seen in a prior study (Roessler et al. 2014). On average, women in rural areas will be less educated, less independent and less well-off. Overall this may constrain their phone use. At the same time, however, as these women face steeper barriers to long-distance communication, access to information, and secure banking, even low levels of phone use may lead to significant improvements in terms of economic independence, empowerment and self-efficacy.\n \nA second key question is how phones compare as a development intervention to the equivalent value of the phone as cash. Introducing a placebo cash condition will be useful both methodologically and substantively. Methodologically, it will help to reduce concern that treatment effects are due to desirability bias from the experimental design (in which subjects report a positive change in their behavior not necessarily due to the benefits of the phone but because of a conscious or subconscious social desire to please the surveyors who distributed the valuable good). Substantively, it will speak to the broader policy question of the merits of technology transfers vs. unconditional cash transfers as poverty-alleviation tools. While there is growing evidence extolling the benefits of both mobile phone ownership and unconditional cash transfers, these two instruments have rarely been compared to each other. Is a woman better off receiving a phone that gives her the power of low-cost communication, information access and mobile banking or collecting the equivalent in cash (representing two weeks\u2019 worth of wages for the average Tanzanian) that she can decide how to use as she best sees fit?\n\nWe thus will test the following primary hypotheses:\n\nH1: Bequests of cellular phones will significantly increase subjects\u2019 use of digital financial services compared to control in rural areas.\nH2: Bequests of cellular phones will significantly increase subjects\u2019 use of digital financial services compared to the placebo cash condition in rural areas.\n\nWe will also evaluate the following secondary hypotheses:\nH3: Bequests of cellular phones will significantly increase subjects\u2019 subjective well-being in terms of economic welfare, social connectedness, healthcare quality, political empowerment, and personal security compared to control in rural areas.\nH4: Bequests of cellular phones will significantly increase subjects\u2019 subjective well-being in terms of economic welfare, social connectedness, healthcare quality, political empowerment, and personal security compared to the placebo cash condition in rural areas.", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Please Hold the Phone: A Field Experiment on Mobile Technology, Uptake of Digital Financial Services and Women\u2019s Empowerment", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": 42215.0, "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "BYU: X15229", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Philip Roessler, Daniel Nielson, Flora Myamba", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Researchers", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "To test the impact of mobile phone ownership on uptake and usage of digital financial services and downstream effects on women\u2019s empowerment, we are undertaking a randomized-controlled trial (RCT) among 400 mobile-less women in two districts of Pwani Region of Tanzania\u2014Rufiji and Kilwa.\n\nTreatment Conditions\nThe experiment has three study groups.\n\nMobile Phone Condition:  Building on a pilot study carried out around Dar es Salaam in summer of 2014, one of the core treatments in Phase 2 will be the distribution of cost-free basic mobile handsets (such as the Nokia 105 mobile phone or equivalent) with SIM card, roughly $5 of starter credit, and a training session on how to use the phone (which includes instructions on how to add credit, check one\u2019s balance, make and receive calls, send SMS, register and use mobile money, and use the mobile money account for savings). 150 women will be assigned to the phone condition.\n\nCash Placebo Condition:  Another 100 women will be randomly assigned to receive an unconditional cash transfer of roughly $25 in Tanzanian Shillings (the equivalent value of the phone and sim card). The cash represents a \u201cplacebo\u201d condition\u2014in the sense that it simulates the actual treatment by giving the participants a valuable good but it does not contain the information, communication, and banking properties that come with the phone. Thus, it will help us to isolate the precise effects of these properties of interest (ICT + financial services) while helping to rule out any bias that may arise from social desirability effects in which subjects given a valuable good feel compelled to tell the enumerators what they believe the researchers want to hear. Accordingly, the placebo condition need not be cash; we could offer a radio that is the same value as the phone but does not it include the communication and banking properties. We prefer to use cash as the placebo condition, however, because it is valuable in its own right vis-\u00e0-vis the control group to learn how a sudden non-trivial windfall affects non-phone owners\u2019 use of digital financial services. Moreover, we could also learn whether participants who receive the cash transfer convert it into a phone, and if not, why not.  \n\nControl Group: Finally, we will randomly assign 150 women to the control group. These women will not receive a phone or cash transfer until the study is completed.\n\nRecruitment and Random Assignment to Treatment\nIn this study we are targeting female smallholder farmers living in the Rufiji and Kilwa Districts of Pwani Region, Tanzania. Recruitment and screening of participants for mobile phone ownership prior to the start of the study will be undertaken by the Journalists Environmental Association of Tanzania (JET), an NGO that works to promote good governance, sustainable agricultural practices, and climate change mitigation in Tanzania. JET will recruit participants from the regular network of farmers it works within the districts. \n\nTo reduce adverse selection into the program by existing phone owners, during initial recruitment and screening of non-phone owners, potential participants will be informed about a new development program for non-phone owners that JET is planning in conjunction with its partner, CARE International, but they will not learn it involves the distribution of cost-free phones.\n\nFor those who are then eligible for the program and consent to participate, a team of female enumerators from REPOA, a research institute in Tanzania, will provide the participants with additional information and see if they are still interested in the program.  \n\nParticipants will be read the following prompt:\n\n\u201cThe Journalists Environmental Association of Tanzania (JET) and CARE International are working together on a program initiative in your area.  The program is in partnership with the mobile network operator, Tigo Tanzania, and Kidogo Kidogo\u2014a social enterprise that works with women in Tanzania. The program entails the provision of mobile phones or a small cash grant to women who do not already own a phone. If you do already own a phone, unfortunately, you are not eligible to participate.\n\nTigo and Kidogo Kidogo are undertaking this initiative because they think it is important that everyone has access to mobile phones. It decided to work with JET and CARE because of the great work the organizations are doing in your districts.\n\nEach person selected for the program will receive a mobile phone with a Tigo sim card or a cash grant. The phone packages are donated free of cost from Kidogo Kidogo and Tigo and are the property of the program recipient. \n\nThe cash is provided by JET and CARE and can be used however the recipient decides is best.\n\nIt is important to note: though everyone in the program will receive a mobile phone or cash, unfortunately at this time, Tigo and Kidogo Kidogo do not have enough phones available to give to everyone right now. \n\nBut don\u2019t worry; they are going to get more phones soon. If you don\u2019t receive a phone or cash grant now, you will get one as the rest of the phones become available, probably in a few months.\n\nTo determine how to distribute the phones that are available now, Kidogo Kidogo and Tigo will use a lottery or luck of the draw. Each person who agrees to participate in the program will be entered into the lottery. Kidogo Kidogo and Tigo will then randomly draw names based on the number of phones they have available.  If your name is drawn, you will be notified by JET and someone from Kidogo Kidogo will come to give you the phone in the near future. Others will be notified once Kidogo Kidogo and Tigo acquire more phones.\u201d\n\nIf a respondent consents to participate, we will then proceed to ask them if they would be willing to take part in a survey. The survey will establish baseline levels of mobile phone access, use of digital financial services, socio-economic characteristics, individual efficacy, employment and farming practices, social connectedness, level of income generation and savings, household gender roles and bargaining, and political participation.\n\nAfter the baseline, we will then randomly assign individuals to the main treatment conditions (control, phone group or cash group) using the data collected from the survey to block randomize on village, age, socio-economic status, and current phone access. \n\nDistribution of Intervention\nA week or so after the completion of the baseline survey, those participants who have been assigned to the phone and cash groups will be notified by JET. The women in the phone group will be invited to a training workshop where they will receive their phone and a training session on its use. The women in the cash group will also be invited to a pick up their cash from a JET officer.", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "Tanzania", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Registration prior to any research activities", "extra": []}, "timestamp": "11/19/2015 - 23:45"}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": 42311.0, "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "IRB application in preparation. ", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "This study seeks to test whether first-hand experience with municipal governance processes increases performance-based voting and, more generally, voters' interest in and receptiveness to performance information about their municipal government. By \"performance-based voting\", we refer to the practice of conditioning vote choices on candidates' expected competence and effort at providing public goods to their constituents, in contrast to with affinity- or identity-based voting.  Our goal is to test whether performance-based voting in municipal elections can be increased by providing voters with the opportunity to gain first-hand experience with municipal decision process. The experiment will be carried out in rural municipalities that are located within six of Burkina Faso's thirteen administrative regions. \n\nWe conjecture that personal exposure to municipal decision processes induces greater awareness of and more personal reflection about the responsibilities of municipal politicians, in a more intensive and profound way than third-party-mediated information about municipal decision processes could normally be expected to. Greater awareness of the responsibilities of municipal politicians, in turn, could cause voters to place greater weight on their performance. Therefore, we expect that personal exposure to municipal decision processes will increase performance-based voting. \n\nThe upcoming 2016 municipal elections in Burkina Faso offer a unique opportunity to investigate the relationship between personal exposure to municipal decision processes and performance-based voting. The reason is that under the current transitional regime, voters can be exposed to real-world municipal institutions and decision processes without simultaneously being exposed to either the incumbent government or to the opposition candidates. The elected municipal governments have been temporarily suspended and have been replaced by externally appointed special delegations that are not themselves contesting in the upcoming municipal elections. The members of the special delegations fulfill the responsibilities of the elected municipal councilors, and the presidents of the special delegations fulfill the responsibilities of the mayors. Municipal decision-making under the special delegations operates within the same legal framework as previously under the elected councils and mayors. This rare and unusual situation makes it possible to manipulate citizens' exposure to municipal decision processes relatively independently of citizens' informedness about the performance of the previous incumbent government, and vice versa. It becomes possible to disentangle the two processes much more than it would normally be possible and to test more directly how exposure to municipal decision processes alters voters' processing of and response to performance information. \n\nIn the experiment, we use two sequential, cross-cutting treatments to manipulate both citizens' personal exposure to municipal decision processes, as well as their access to performance information about the previous incumbent, independently of one another. To manipulate citizens' personal exposure to municipal decision processes, our local collaboration partner, the Programme d'Appui aux Collectivit\u00e9s Territoriales (PACT) works with the presidents of the special delegations to personally invite randomly selected voting-age citizens from different villages to attend a special delegation meeting, typically for the first time in their lives. After completion of the citizen-invitation intervention, we provide a random subset of voters in the treatment and control groups of the meeting-invitation intervention with performance information about the previous incumbent municipal government. This performance information was collected in 2014, prior to the political transition. Therefore, it is unambiguously attributable to the previous elected municipal government, rather than to the non-elected interim government, and will be presented accordingly. \n\nOur primary outcomes of interest are (1) vote choice, (2) voter turnout, and (3) the weight voters give to performance information in their vote choice. The key hypotheses are specified below. \n\nWe plan to submit a detailed research design document and pre-analysis plan prior to the implementation of the performance information treatment. The performance information treatment will be carried out in conjunction with a citizen survey that targets individuals assigned to the treatment and control conditions of the meeting-invitation intervention. This survey will take place prior to the 2016 municipal elections. \n\nThe purpose of this initial design registration is to document the central hypotheses and research design features of this study prior to the public release of results from any other study that is part of the EGAP Metaketa cluster on information and voter behavior.

This is likely due to the high normative value assigned to increasing turnout, which does not carry over to the specifics of how one casts a ballot.  However, administrators who run elections often seek to influence when and how voters cast their ballots in order to reduce costs and keep elections running smoothly.  \nAdditionally, since voting methods present different possibilities of social rewards (Arceneaux, Kousser, & Mullin 2012; Kousser & Mullin 2007; Funk 2005), messages aimed at making these social benefits salient to voters will provide some evidence on whether voters consider the visibility of voting when making their decisions on how to vote.  There is evidence that people value being seen as a voter (Gerber, Huber, Doherty, & Dowling 2015; Gerber & Rogers 2009), but evidence has yet to be presented that clearly links ability to fulfill this motivation with higher voter turnout.\nOne experiment (Herrnson, Hamner, & Koh 2015) has examined the effects of messages on the method of balloting.  In the 2010 general election in Maryland, the authors sent randomized messages in mailings to active registered voters encouraging the use of the new voting reforms (no-excuse absentee, early in-person, and absentee with a downloadable ballot).  While messaging about the convenience of early voting had no effect on early voting usage, a message stating that early voting was adopted in response to citizen demand yielded a 3% increase in early voting, from 14% to 17% of the registered voters.  They also found that informational and convenience treatments about the downloadable ballot led to a significant increase in the use of this method.  \nAlthough the Herrnson et al. (2015) study provides much useful data on the effectiveness of different messages, it did not include all of the messages that may be effective at changing voters\u2019 behavior.  The literature on social benefits suggests that this is an important factor and messages emphasizing them may increase the use of in-person voting.  Studies on voters in vote-by-mail systems have shown that voting confidence is a very salient issue (Stein, Menger, & Vonnahme 2015; Flaxman et al. 2015), so stating that early in-person return yields higher confidence should have an effect on both method and timing of voting.  While no literature has examined messages on stopping campaign calls, anecdotal evidence suggests that many voters tire of getting constant calls from campaigns and may vote earlier to avoid future calls.  Using a similar design to this study, we will test these different types of messages in addition to a purely informational message and one that emphasizes responsiveness to citizen demand in the setting of El Paso County, Colorado.\nExperimental Context\nIn 2013 the state of Colorado adopted vote-by-mail elections, in which every registered voter is mailed a ballot three weeks before Election Day.  Voters can return their ballots by mail or in-person at Voter Service and Processing Centers (centralized locations with election staff) or at un-manned drop-off locations.  In order to avoid large rushes of ballots in the last few days of the election, county clerks would prefer voters to return their ballots as soon as possible after making their vote choices and in-person rather than by mail .  The clerks expect early and in-person return of ballots to reduce the costs of processing ballots and increase the timeliness and accuracy of vote counts.\nWe are working with the County Clerks Office for El Paso County, Colorado in order to test the effectiveness of different messages at encouraging in-person ballot return, early ballot return, or both in combination.\nMessages\nPrevious research indicates voters may change their method and timing of voting in response to: opportunities to receive the social rewards of voting , stopping calls from candidates urging them to vote , assurance that their ballot will be counted by election night , and knowledge that methods were provided in direct response to their requests .\nWe are testing the efficacy of messages aimed at these motivations that may influence when and where voters return their mailed ballots.  The exact wording of the messages, including an informational control message, is below.\nControl Message:\nAs you may know, the State of Colorado recently adopted a new election system in which all active registered voters are mailed a ballot for each election. Along with this notice is your mail ballot packet for the upcoming election on November 3, 2015.\nYou may return your ballot through the postal service, or you may drop it off in person at any Voter Service and Polling Center or secure drop-off location listed on the secrecy sleeve included with your mail ballot packet. Keep in mind that ballots returned through the mail may take up to three days to be delivered.\nIn addition to the control message the treatments include one of the following paragraphs, placed in between the two informational paragraphs of the control message:\nTreatment I: Voter Confidence\nYou can help ensure that election results are reported as early as possible on Election Day by returning your ballot as soon as you have marked your choices. By returning your ballot early, you can be confident that your vote will be included when the first unofficial election results are announced.\nTreatment II: Stop the Calls\nIf you are like many voters in El Paso County you may receive numerous calls, mailings, and other communications from campaigns. By returning your ballot early, campaigns will see that you have already voted and will have no reason to contact you. Help stop the calls by returning your ballot as soon as you have marked your choices!\nTreatment III: Social Rewards\nFor some people, mailing off a completed ballot doesn\u2019t give them the same voting experience as casting a ballot in person with other people. However, many voters find that dropping off their completed ballot provides a similar experience of traveling to a Voter Service and Polling Center, with the added convenience of filling out their ballot at home.\nTreatment IV: Responsiveness\nAn increasing number of El Paso County voters prefer to return their ballot in person rather than mailing their ballot to our office. In response to changing voter demand we have increased the number of convenient 24 hour secure ballot drop-off locations which are listed on the enclosed secrecy sleeve.\n\n", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": 410000.0, "extra": []}, "id": "20151120AB", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "D72", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "We hypothesize that the first two treatment messages (Treatments I & II) will increase the probability that voters will return their ballots earlier in the voting period rather than closer to Election Day.

We further expect that, due to its activation of voters\u2019 desire to be seen voting, the social rewards message (Treatment III) will have the largest positive effect on increasing in-person ballot return.\nWe do not expect that any of the messages will have an effect on the probability of voter turnout by all methods combined.\n", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Can Messages from Administrators Influence the Method and Timing of Voting?

In that experiment I found that when subjects are confronted with a corrupt candidate, support for such candidate drops as voters learn more specific details of the source of misappropriated funds and about the destination of those funds. In that experiment I used a baseline treatment condition where subjects only learn that candidate has antecedents of administrative irregularities. I used four additional treatment conditions in which I provided subjects with complementary information on the source of those funds (expenditures destined to public hospitals or expenditures in technical services to repair computers in municipal secretaries) and on the destination of those misappropriated funds (a mayor\u2019s bank account or to support party members who helped the mayor in the electoral campaign) with a 2x2 factorial design. The two alternative types of source of funds attempted to capture a continuum from expenditures that are generally more valued by voters (social services) to expenditures where the benefits for the public are less obvious .

In areas such as medicine (Gigerenzer 2002), regulation (Sunstein 2007), climate science (Budescu et al. 2014), and national security (Johnston 2004), experts are typically uncomfortable expressing probabilities with numeric precision, and often avoid offering assessing uncertainty at all. Studying more than three thousand doctor-patient interactions, for instance, Braddock et al. (1999) found that physicians described uncertainty about treatment outcomes in 17 percent of complex procedures. In a review of 379 declassified National Intelligence Estimates, Friedman and Zeckhauser (2012) found that four percent of key judgments conveyed probability using quantitative expressions or phrasings with clear numeric equivalents.\n\nVague probability assessments can have clear, negative consequences. In 1961, the Joint Chiefs of Staff determined that the proposed Bay of Pigs invasion was highly tenuous, estimating its chances of success as roughly one in three. But in their report to President John F. Kennedy, the Chiefs wrote only that \u201cthis plan has a fair chance of success,\u201d which Kennedy took to indicate support for the proposal (Wyden 1979, 88-90). Similarly, in his post mortem review of the space shuttle Challenger explosion, Richard Feynman (1986) found that managers and engineers held estimates of rocket failure rates that differed, on average, by a factor of one thousand. Both cases demonstrated obvious miscommunication, generated sharp criticism, and raised the possibility that major crises could have been averted if public officials had made clearer probability assessments.\n\nIn some fields, vague probability assessments are deliberately encouraged by official guidelines. For instance the U.S. Director of National Intelligence\u2019s 2015 directive on \u201cAnalytic Standards\u201d instructs intelligence analysts to assess likelihood using \u201cwords of estimative probability\u201d that correspond to seven different segments of the number line. This spectrum helps to mitigate extreme miscommunication as in the Bay of Pigs example, but the difference is of degree and not kind. To use this guidance properly, analysts must quantify their judgments and then coarsen those judgments into vaguer, qualitative terms.  A similar set of guidelines can be found in U.S. Army doctrine on \u201cComposite Risk Management.\u201d \n\nThere are several reasons why many scholars and practitioners advocate qualitative probability expressions, but this project focuses on two of those arguments in detail. First, many scholars and practitioners argue that quantifying probability estimates would expose analysts to undue criticism when their estimates fall on the \u201cwrong side of maybe.\u201d Second, clear probability assessments might constrain decision makers\u2019 freedom of action, as explicit expressions of doubt could make policy choices more difficult to sell to the public or more challenging to defend after the fact. Both of these arguments imply that even if quantitative probability assessments are ideal in principle, bureaucratic and political incentives prevent this idea from being implemented in practice. I refer to this idea as cautionary vagueness, which I define as the use of intentionally vague probability assessments as a strategy for mitigating criticism. \n\nThough the idea of cautionary vagueness appears widely in scholarship on national security decision making, I argue that there are two main reasons to question this strategy\u2019s effectiveness. First, even if vague probability assessments mitigate blame in some contexts, they can also mitigate credit. When probability assessments fall on the \u201cright side of maybe,\u201d or when risky decisions succeed, public officials may have incentives to emphasize the clarity of their probabilistic reasoning. The logic of cautionary vagueness thus supposes that the benefits of blame avoidance outweigh the costs to credit-claiming. This is plausible, but it is an empirical claim that has never been tested directly, especially in a national security context.\n\nSecond, it is not clear why quantitative probability assessments should expose analysts and decision makers to greater scrutiny than employing \u201cwords of estimative probability.\u201d It would be one thing for analysts and decision makers to avoid making probability assessments at all: but if they do express probability, does calling a conclusion \u201clikely\u201d really invite less criticism than making an estimate of \u201c65 percent\u201d? In fact, numeric assessments could even mitigate criticism in some cases by dispelling impressions of misplaced certainty. Again, it is an open empirical question as to whether these countervailing effects alleviate or intensify blame on the whole.\n\nThis project aims to provide the first systematic exploration of cautionary vagueness. The theoretical purpose of this project is to translate ideas about cautionary vagueness into falsifiable hypotheses (and to explain why those hypotheses are worth scrutinizing). I then test those hypotheses using original survey experiments asking respondents to evaluate the quality of analysis and decision making.\n", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": 2000.0, "extra": []}, "id": "20151125AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "Probability assessments are inherently difficult to evaluate. Consider a financial analyst who states that there is a 70 percent chance that a stock price will go up. If the stock price instead goes down, then we can say that the analyst\u2019s estimate was on the \u201cwrong side of maybe,\u201d but there is rarely an objective way to know how much we should attribute this particular discrepancy to bad estimation versus bad luck. Nevertheless, many people naturally criticize estimates that fall on the wrong side of maybe, assuming that uncertain outcomes should have been predictable before the fact. This is called hindsight bias (Fischhoff 1975, Tetlock and Lebow 2001). Analysts may leave probability assessments intentionally vague so as to mitigate such criticism. \n\nScholars of national security often reference this kind of cautionary vagueness. Mark Lowenthal (2006, 128-29), a scholar with three decades\u2019 experience in the U.S. Intelligence Community, criticizes intelligence analysts for using \u201cweasel words\u201d to escape criticism, arguing that this behavior represents \u201canalytical pusillanimity.\u201d  \n\nOne way in which national security may be distinct from other areas of high-stakes decision making is that decision makers might also prefer for analysts to leave probability assessments vague.  Dean Acheson (1969, 375), U.S. Secretary of State under President Harry Truman, argued that public officials must often make decisions \u201cclearer than truth,\u201d glossing over doubts in order to defend policy choices to the public. Joshua Rovner (2011) develops a theory of intelligence-policy relations which holds that decision makers aim to cherry-pick analyses in order to oversell their policies. This behavior relates to what scholars call outcome bias: the idea that many people naturally evaluate decision makers on the basis of whether or not their actions appear to have been successful (Baron and Hershey 1988, Gurdal, Miller, and Rustichini 2013).  Combined with partisan pressures, outcome bias can lead critics to seize on any information that might raise doubts about the quality of a decision. Explicitly acknowledging uncertainty about a decision\u2019s outcome may court this kind of pushback from critical constituencies.\n\nUnderstanding the use of probability in national security and other areas of high-stakes decision making thus requires grappling with cautionary vagueness, whether or not one approves of the practice. Yet there are two main reasons to question whether cautionary vagueness is as effective as the conventional wisdom supposes.\n\nFirst, even if precise probability assessments engender blame when estimates fall on the wrong side of maybe, they may also increase credit when estimates fall on the right side of maybe. Following the successful 2011 raid on Osama bin Laden\u2019s compound in Pakistan, for instance, President Barack Obama and his advisers described to the media how they had parsed probability assessments about the chances that Al Qaeda\u2019s leader was living in that location, including several debates involving numeric percentages.  Presumably, White House and intelligence officials believed that this information would improve public perceptions of how carefully they had handled uncertainty. President Obama remarked in an interview regarding his decision making process for the bin Laden raid that, \u201cone of the things you learn as president is that you\u2019re always dealing with probabilities\u201d (Bowden 2012, 161). All participants in this debate were eager to emphasize how this decision was surrounded by uncertainty. \n\nCautionary vagueness thus only benefits public officials if quantifying probability assessments increases blame more than it increases credit. This is plausible: some scholars posit a general negativity bias in public affairs in which blame for bad outcomes tends to stronger than credit for good outcomes (Hood 2011, 9-14). But to date, this claim has not been tested in a national security context.\n\nA second reason to question the logic of cautionary vagueness is that precise probability assessments may actually mitigate some kinds of criticism. In the case of the L\u2019Aquila earthquake, public officials were literally put on trial for making their assessments too vague. Similarly, the 2002 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iraq\u2019s Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction provides an example of how imprecise analysis can plausibly increase analysts\u2019 blame exposure. \n\nThe bumper-sticker summary of the Iraq NIE is that the U.S. Intelligence Community thought it was a \u201cslam dunk\u201d to conclude that Saddam Hussein was pursuing nuclear weapons. But the estimate itself does not say this \u2013 in fact, the NIE\u2019s key judgments contain no direct statements about the likelihood that Iraq was developing nuclear weapons. Many key judgments refer to Iraq pursuit of \u201cweapons of mass destruction,\u201d which included biological and chemical weapons in addition to nuclear weapons.  The NIE states that \u201cin the view of most agencies, Baghdad is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program,\u201d but the estimate includes a specific dissent on this point from the U.S. State Department and does not assess of the probability that this statement is true. To be sure, the information and assumptions presented in the NIE are widely mistaken, and the estimate seems designed to convince readers to believe that Iraq was actively pursuing a nuclear bomb. But this point is mostly implied: it is not stated explicitly, let alone accompanied by a clear probability assessment.\n\nJervis (2006), among others, has thus argued that one of the most important flaws with the Iraq NIE is not just that its arguments were wrong but that the uncertainty surrounding those estimates was left vague. In hindsight, it is impossible to say how the U.S. Intelligence Community might have quantified the probability that Saddam Hussein was pursuing nuclear weapons in 2002. But even if the NIE\u2019s authors had assessed this probability to be as high as 80 percent or 90 percent, this could not have been construed after the fact as a \u201cslam dunk,\u201d and it might have generated useful debate about the sources and implications of residual doubt. Consistent with this point, post-mortem reviews of Iraq WMD intelligence written by the U.S. Senate (2004, 16), the Silberman-Robb Commission (2005, 409, 419), and the UK\u2019s Butler Review (2004, 145) all conclude that a major lesson from the episode is the need for clearer communication of uncertainty.\n\nMoreover, it is not at all obvious why numeric percentages should court more controversy than using the \u201cwords of estimative probability\u201d that are currently recommended by the U.S. Director of National Intelligence. Unless analysts constantly use the term \u201ceven chance,\u201d then employing words of estimative probability always runs a risk of falling on the wrong side of maybe. The question then becomes whether assessing a probability as \u201c65 percent\u201d would make analysts worse off than saying that some judgment is \u201clikely\u201d to be true. Again, this assumption is plausible, but unsupported by systematic evidence.\n\nHypotheses\n\nI believe that the key questions about cautionary vagueness can be translated into six testable hypotheses. These hypotheses capture arguments about how quantifying probability assessments could either exacerbate or reduce public officials\u2019 exposure to criticism. Where relevant, I explicitly distinguish mechanisms influencing analysts versus decision makers. Following a standard distinctions in the decision sciences, I define analysts as individuals providing probability assessments and decision makers as individuals who use that information to judge prospective actions. I use the term public officials to describe both analysts and decision makers together.\n\nHypothesis 1: Quantifying probability assessments increases criticism. Many scholars and practitioners are inherently skeptical of quantifying subjective judgments. It is thus possible that quantifying probability assessments always exposes analysts and decision makers to criticism. If true, this argument would support the argument that public officials have incentives to leave probability assessments vague.\n\nHypothesis 2: Quantifying probability assessments increases hindsight bias. Probability assessments are especially exposed to criticism when they fall on the \u201cwrong side of maybe.\u201d Many scholars and practitioners believe that quantitative assessments suggest an illusion of rigor that may exacerbate such criticism. If true, this argument would support the argument that analysts have an incentive to leave probability assessments vague.\n\nHypothesis 3: Quantifying probability assessments increases outcome bias. Decision makers are especially exposed to criticism when their actions are unsuccessful. Quantifying probability assessments could exacerbate such criticism by emphasizing how decision makers knowingly took risky actions. If true, this argument would support the argument that decision makers have an incentive to prefer that probability assessments be left vague.\n\nHypothesis 4: Quantifying probability assessments increases credit given to analysts who fall on the \u201cright side of maybe.\u201d If quantifying probability assessments exposes unlucky analysts to greater criticism, then this might also facilitate credit-claiming when those assessments appear to be confirmed by subsequent events. If true, this argument would imply that analysts may not always have incentives to leave probability assessments vague.\n\nHypothesis 5: Quantifying probability assessments increases credit given to decisions with successful outcomes. If quantifying probability assessments creates an illusion of rigor surrounding analysis and decision making, this may work to decision makers\u2019 credit when their actions are perceived to be effective. If true, this argument would imply that decision makers may not always have incentives to prefer that probability assessments be left vague.\n\nHypothesis 6: Quantifying probability assessments expands blame more than it expands credit. If vague probability assessments entail countervailing effects with respect to blame avoidance versus credit-claiming, then a key question is whether either of these effects is clearly stronger on net. If the \u201cnegativity bias\u201d holds, such that quantifying probability assessments generally expands blame more than credit, then this would support the argument that public officials have incentives to leave probability estimates vague.\n", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Cautionary Vagueness and Probability Assessment in High-Stakes Decision Making", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": 42328.0, "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "STUDY00029111 (Dartmouth)", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Jeffrey Friedman", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Amazon MTurk", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "In order to test the hypotheses, I designed a survey experiment that presents respondents with either of two descriptive vignettes.

The second vignette involves a drone strike targeting Al Qaeda leaders in Yemen. \n\nEach vignette involves four paragraphs describing how intelligence analysts and national security decision makers assessed uncertainty. The first paragraph describes whether the operation succeeded or failed. For the hostage rescue mission, this paragraph explains either that U.S. special forces retrieved the hostages, or that they found the hostages were not present. Either way, U.S. forces sustained casualties in conducting the mission. In the drone strike vignette, the first paragraph explains either that the attack killed three senior Al Qaeda leaders or that it had mistakenly targeted a wedding party. Either way, civilians were killed in the attack, which generated local protests.\n\nThe second paragraph of each vignette describes how \u201csources involved with planning the operation stressed that it was a difficult decision that required wrestling with uncertainty.\u201d The paragraph describes several pieces of evidence on which intelligence analysts based their judgments. These pieces of evidence remain constant across scenario versions.\nThe third paragraph of each vignette describes the probability that analysts assigned to the hostages being present, or to the targets of the drone strike being correctly identified. These assessments vary on two dimensions. First, some assessments were above fifty percent, and some were below fifty percent. Thus the scenarios randomly vary whether or not analysts proved to be on the \u201cwrong side of maybe\u201d (though the information on which they based their judgments was always presented identically). Second, some assessments are expressed using words (either \u201clikely\u201d or \u201cunlikely\u201d) and some assessments were expressed using numbers (either \u201c65 percent\u201d or \u201c35 percent\u201d).  These probability assessments are each presented twice, highlighted in quotes. \n\nThe third paragraph concludes with a quote from an unnamed official stating, \u201cThis was a probability thing, and we made sure to weigh the costs and benefits of this operation as thoroughly as possible.\u201d The phrasing mimics a statement reportedly made by President Obama during a debate over the bin Laden raid, and is meant to reinforce the probabilistic nature of the decision. The fourth paragraph of each vignette, which remains constant across scenario versions, presents quotes from public officials stating that \u201cwe analyzed the evidence from every angle we could think of\u201d; \u201cIn these kinds of situations, you have to be willing to take risks\u201d; and \u201cI supported this decision because I believed we could defend it no matter how the mission turned out.\u201d \n\nEach respondent will be presented with only one version of only one vignette. After reading the vignette, respondents are asked to \u201cPlease write a few sentences describing how you believe you would have reacted to the uncertainty in this scenario if it had been your decision.\u201d Then respondents are asked, \u201cBased only on the information you read in this scenario, please indicate your level of agreement with each of the following statements.\u201d The first statement is, \u201cU.S. officials made the right decision.\u201d The second statement is, \u201cThe intelligence analysis supporting this decision was sound.\u201d Levels of agreement are recorded on seven-point scales with 1 defined as \u201cStrongly Disagree,\u201d 4 defined as \u201cNeutral,\u201d and 7 defined as \u201cStrongly agree.\u201d These response measures serve as the main dependent variables capturing support or criticism for this study. Asking about levels of agreement/disagreement is intended to avoid priming respondents by directly asking about levels of \u201csupport\u201d or \u201cblame\u201d for their actions.\n\nAfter recording these responses, respondents receive two multiple-choice attention-check questions. The first question asks respondents to identify the outcome of the mission. The second question asks respondents to identify the probability that intelligence analysts attached to their assessment. Respondents who do not answer both questions correctly will be denied payment, and their responses will not appear in the data. After completing these attention-check questions, respondents complete a Berlin adaptive numeracy test (Cokely et al. 2012), and a short battery of demographic questions.\n\nI will conduct this experiment on Amazon MTurk, with an initial run of 2,000 respondents. This sample size is based on the following power calculation.\n  -The experiment effectively involves four kinds of scenarios, based on a 2x2 division of (a) whether the decision was successful, and (b) whether analysts provided a favorable or unfavorable assessment. Within each scenario format, I am interested in the treatment effect of quantifying probability assessments.\n  -With 2,000 respondents, there are 500 respondents per scenario format. I aim to identify a treatment effect of 0.5 points.

In post-conflict countries, institutional changes that address security vacuums that existed during the civil war may help improve civilians perception of the security forces and of the state and it may even increase support for the state.   On one hand, government forces may have been implicated in much of the atrocities and repression that occurred during the war.  On the other hand, insurgent forces may have inflicted violence because government forces were too weak.  Thus, it is possible that reforms that address government abuse and government incapacity may help change citizens\u2019 beliefs and actions toward the state. \n\nThis project evaluates whether two security sector reforms help address the protection gap that may have existed during civil wars.  Female ratio balancing or the integration of women into the security forces may alleviate some concerns that the security forces are too abusive and the increased presence of security personnel into the rural periphery may help address concerns about violence by non-state actors.  It does so by randomizing police patrols by sex in one of Liberia\u2019s most remote counties.  Teams of male or female police officers visited randomly select households in Grand Kru County and spent 30min speaking to household members about police reforms.  The project assesses whether these visits affected perceptions and support for the state by comparing individuals from households that received visits by men or women to households that did not receive visits.  \n\nThe specific research questions are:\n1) Do security sector reforms that increase the strength of the security forces lead to perceptions of effectiveness of the security forces? \n2) Do security sector reforms that constrain the security forces lead to perceptions of restraint of the security forces? \n3) Do reforms that address protection gaps lead to enhanced perceptions of the state?\n4) Do reforms that address protection gaps lead to enhanced support for the state?\n5) Is information about reforms or exposure to reforms more important for enhanced perceptions of and support for the state?", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": 1275.0, "extra": []}, "id": "20151128AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "There are a number of hypotheses that will be tested related to perceptions and behavior.

The treatment takes place at the household level, and includes a scripted visit by two LNP officers. Households in the control group do not receive visits by LNP officers.  Twenty-five villages are selected in Grand Kru County out of a sample of 45 villages that have more than 80 households.  The officers will visit 15 of the villages, while the remaining 10 villages will not receive visits by police officers. There are three separate treatments. The first treatment is direct exposure and conversation with male officers.  The second treatment is exposure and conversation with female officers.  There are two control groups.  The first control group includes households in villages that did not receive any visits by police officers.  The second control group include households from villages that received visits from police officers, but are households that were not randomly selected to receive the treatment.   The third treatment is information about the LNP provided by enumerators (no visits). \n\nOfficers for the project were chosen based on their similarity in personality.  The LNP provided fifteen Kru-speaking officers.  From these, I recorded each of the officers giving a speech and speaking to an audience about the role of the LNP.  I then showed the videos to a group of Kru people in Monrovia and had them rate the officers on different characteristics.  Based on the similarity of scores, I chose four officers\u2014\u0080\u0094two female and two male. \n\nThe assumption is that when the police officers visit the households, they treat the entire household (all individuals within it).  They are to speak to the entire household when they visit them.  However, one sided non-compliance may be an issue if those that received the treatment may not be home when the outcome survey is conducted.  Or, the randomized selection of the individual in the household may not yield a person that was treated (present during the officer visit).  In other words, not all the household members may be treated.  To account for this, the research design takes on an intent to treat research design.  It makes the assumption that the visit to the household affects everyone in the household.  \n\nOutcomes are measured at two different time periods.  Immediate outcomes are measured during the officers'\u0080\u0099 visits. About one month after the officer visit, a team of enumerators will survey the treated individuals in \u0080\u0094the individuals with whom the police officers conversed.   This end-line survey will be conducted in both control and treated villages; individuals in the ``pure\" control group will be selected randomly through the same random walk procedure used to select the treatment group.  They will ask the community leaders for a list of quarters and randomly select quarters in which to conduct the survey.  They will use a random walk method and survey every other house.   The enumeration team that conducts the end-line survey will be introduced as conducting a survey for the Center for Applied Research (CART), a Liberian NGO, on education, security, and health.  \n\nThere are three outcome variables to measure: perceptions of the security sector related to effectiveness and restraint, perceptions of the state, and support for the state.  The first set includes measuring perceptions of effectiveness/ineffectiveness, restraint/abuse of the state institutions (police).  To do so, I conduct a  large-N survey of all treatment and control households.  The survey includes fifteen questions that assess perceptions of the security sector. \n\nAnother way support will be measured is through monetary compensation.  To test whether individuals are willing to support the state, all individuals (control groups included) will be given 90 Liberian Dollars for their participation in the survey.  At the end of the survey, the enumerator will ask the individual whether the person wants to donate some portion of their money to either the community or the police to ensure security.  The option of giving to the community or the state will be randomly assigned.\n\nFinally, the last way to measure support is through the counting the number of phone calls made to the police station after the visits.  The officers and enumerators (for control villages) will distribute cards with phone numbers to the nearest depot. The cards that the officers give out will have phone numbers that correspond to different numbers at the LNP depot. When officers answer the phone, they will ask for the household number on the card, so that these data can also be added to the database.  Police officers in the depot will record the phone calls for a period of 3 months after the visits.  Calls from treated households may indicate that they are now willing to use state institutions instead of relying on informal ones. \n\nThere are some additional behavioral outcomes that can be measured during the initial visit that assess the perceptions of restraint, effectiveness, and support between Treatment 1 and Treatment 2 only.  The enumerators will record immediate behavioral responses during the interaction between police officers and community members.\n\n The models will use randomization inference.  Two-tail tests will be used in the analyses to test whether police presence has a positive or negative impact. The data will be presented using covariates and without using covariates.  If there is imbalance on any of the indicators above, these will be included in the statistical models.  Standard errors will be clustered at the village level.  Conventional p-value levels will be upper \u0080\u0094p-values that are below 0.05, although p-values of 0.1 will also be presented.  \n\nControl variables include:  sex, age, household income, religion, membership in traditional leadership, land ownership, education level, cognitive ability, participation in armed groups, past experience with the security sector, past experience with the government, and participation in community watch teams.  These variables may also be used as control variables depending on balance. \n\nFor continuous measures, I cap outliers at the 99th percentile. I exclude any observations with a dfbeta greater than 2/sqrt(N). \n\nI will compute the Average Effect Size within each cluster, following the procedure proposed in Kling et al. (2004) and Clingingsmith et al. (2008).  Questions will be clustered based on questions related to effectiveness and restraint.

Our specific expectation is that respondents will be more likely to read a fact-check of a statement from a party that they do not identify with or feel positively toward (H1a) and that providing a graphic indicating that the rating is mixed will increase the prevalence of this type of selective exposure (H1b). These effects may vary by political sophistication (i.e., knowledge) or sample - i.e., general population vs. Pagella Politica/Italian news site reader (RQ1). We also are interested to see if people are inclined to select fact-checks about the issue they see as the most important problem (RQ2a), which is our primary measure of issue salience, and whether selective exposure is greater on high-salience issues of this type (RQ2b).

While we discuss the design in more detail below, key features are necessary to explain our hypotheses. Respondents are assigned to one of three conditions -- receive fact-checking content regardless of which content they would prefer (25%), receive entertainment content regardless of the content they prefer (25%), or receive the content they prefer (50%). \n\nOn average, we expect that exposure to fact-checking leads to learning about politics. Thus, our overall expectations are that respondents in the assigned exposure condition will learn more than those in the content choice condition relative to the control group (H2). We also expect learning effects to be lower for counter-attitudinal information than for pro-attitudinal information in the assigned exposure condition (H3a) and when comparing learning in the the content choice condition and assigned exposure conditions relative to the control group (H3b).

We have identified competing arguments as to how we think the average person feels about the political process as it stands in Africa.  On one hand, it seems apparent to us that the average citizen should show a lack of support or even disdain for elite based politics as it is a system and process that does not benefit them and often makes their lives harder than they otherwise would be.

Yet, it is also a place with a history of elite politics both at the national and local level, thus making it an excellent place to ask our questions about elite politics in Africa.  To test our hypotheses, we will use an experimental conjoint analysis (e.g., see Hainmueller et al. (2013)).  We will implement a survey in which respondents will be given a choice between two hypothetical candidates to represent them in the Ivorian National Assembly.  After evaluating each candidate's characteristics, respondents will be asked to indicate which candidate they would be more likely to vote for in an election.  Following their indication of voting preference, respondents will be asked to express and explain their overall impression of each candidate.  Candidates can be evaluated by respondents as either very unattractive, slightly less attractive than normal, okay, slightly more attractive than normal, or a very attractive candidate.  Respondents will also be allowed to offer an explanation of what candidate variables drive their impression before being offered an opportunity to repeat the exercise with two new candidates.  Having respondents consider candidates in two different election scenarios allows us to gain observations and to further vary our treatments by respondent.  Following the third election scenario, the respondents will be asked to identify their own characteristics to see if some responses vary by an interaction between respondent characteristics and candidate characteristics.

This study uses proximity to the migrants' route through Denmark as a measure of exposure to the migrant crisis.

In the interviews, we asked the leaders to explain what they would expect their citizens, senior chiefs, and other government officials, to do if they were to make \u201ca bad decision\u201d. We then asked them what a \u201cbad decision\u201d would entail from the perspective of each of these actors.  \n\nWe also conducted two citizen focus groups of five people in each of the five districts (50 subjects total). Participants for the focus groups were recruited from those passing through a busy intersection; enumerators were instructed to maximize diversity in terms of age, gender, and apparent wealth. Focus group participants were asked to report on their ability and willingness to take action against their traditional leaders; whether those actions were effective; and the type of malfeasance that spurred the action. (See attached appendix for full battery of questions.)\n\nTo analyse the results, we will determine whether the frequencies in the data accord with predictions; the sample is far too small for statistical power. We will use qualitative analysis produce a listing of the types of malfeasance that superiors and citizens care about, and the mechanisms of sanction, if any, that each of these actors have recourse to.\nPart Two\n\nIn the experimental portion of the design, we provided a valuable development good \u2013 iron sheets  \u2013 to local traditional leaders. We randomized whether leaders were told they would be audited, the intensity of the audit they were told to expect, and who would receive information about their decision. The study was conducted among a random sample of 200 traditional leaders, five from each of forty villages across eight districts.  Chiefs and communities who participated in the qualitative portion of the study were excluded from the experimental sample. \n\nA trained enumerator arranged a visit with each chief, and informed him that he would be receiving two iron sheets to give to a needy household in the community. In a face-to-face interaction with the  enumerator, the leader identified and described the characteristics of the two neediest households in the community, as well as the two households most in need of permanent roofing materials in particular.  \n\nThe enumerator then read one of four randomly assigned scripts that informed the leader whether he could expect an audit, and of what type. The control group was not informed about any auditing and told simply to distribute the sheets as they saw fit. Those in three treatments conditions were audited. Those in treatment two (basic audit) were told we would call in a few weeks to learn name of the household to whom they provided the sheets. Those in treatment two were told we would call and return to the site to photograph the household that received the sheets. Those in treatment four were told they would be called, photographed, and that we would send letters to their district-level officials acknowledging receipt of the sheets and indicating the name of the household they had selected to receive them. \n\nAfter the script was read, the leaders were then asked to identify the one household to which they intended to provide the iron sheets; this could be one the households already identified as poor, or it could be another household entirely. This is the household that was named in the letter to the district officials.\n\nThe source of variation in the data is twofold. There are cross-subject treatments that assign leaders assigned to one treatment as opposed to another. There are also within-subject treatments: all leaders identified households in need of iron sheeting both before and after learning they would (or would not) be subject to an audit. \n\nRegardless of the assigned treatment, we returned to every site and conducted a post-treatment focus group. The focus groups, composed of people who were unconnected to the chief but well-informed about community business, independently reported the characteristics of the four households the leaders told us were needy before treatment; the characteristics of the household the leader said would receive the sheet after treatment; and the characteristics of the household (if any) that actually received the sheets.  \n\nWe will compare  means with an appropriate hypothesis test (e.g. t-test).

We have multiple measures of each outcome, and also questions designed to assess whether the effect of aid on perceptions of governance is due to the information aid signals about governance or the presumed effects of aid on governance. \n\nA. Quality of aid projects\n\nFirst, we are interested in seeing whether respondents think differently about aid that goes through the government versus aid that goes to NGOs.  We ask two questions to measure respondents\u2019 perceptions of the quality of aid.\n\n1. Aid Benefits: How many people respondents think foreign aid has benefited in Yumbe (None of them, some of them, most of them, all of them)\n2. Aid Responsiveness: How likely respondents think it is that foreign aid to Yumbe has been spent on the projects that the people of Yumbe wanted most (Very likely, somewhat likely, somewhat unlikely, very unlikely)\n\n\nB. Quality of government\n\nB1. Aid as Signal of Government Quality\n\nDo citizens make inferences about their local governments depending on whether it is receiving increased aid and whether that increased aid is going to the district government or else is going to NGOs in the district?  We look at four outcomes: two related to the respondents\u2019 perceptions of the district government in question, and two related to how respondents perceive likely levels of compliance behavior among citizens in the district.\n\n1. Performance: How well respondents think the government of Yumbe was performing in 2012 (Very well, somewhat well, somewhat poorly, very poorly)\n2. Corruption: How many people in the district administration in Yumbe respondents think were involved in corruption in 2012 (None of them, some of them, most of them, all of them)\n3. Compliance (I): The district government in Yumbe is responsible for collecting fees for business licenses, market stands and other such things. What proportion of people in Yumbe district do you think actually paid the fees they owed the district in 2012? (None of them, few of them, some of them, most of them)\n4. Compliance (II): The district government in Yumbe is responsible for organizing community meetings on important public health issues. How many people in Yumbe district do you think actually attended the meetings on public health issues organized by the district government in 2012? (None of them, few of them, some of them, most of them)\n\nB2. Aid as Cause of Governance Quality\n\nDo citizens believe that aid will change government behavior and citizen interactions with government?  We assess this by measuring respondents\u2019 perceptions of how government quality and citizen compliance will have changed over time in the wake of increasing aid flows.\n\n1. Performance: In the past three years, do you think performance of the district administration in Yumbe district has increased or declined? (Increased, no change, declined)\n2. Corruption: In the past three years, do you think the number of people in the district administration in Yumbe involved in corruption has increased or declined? (Increased, no change, declined)\n3. Compliance (I): In the past three years, do you think the number of people in Yumbe district who are have actually participated in clean-up campaigns to remove garbage has increased or decreased? (Increased, no change, declined)\n4. Compliance (II): In the past three years, do you think the number of people in Yumbe district who attended public health meetings organized by the district government has increased or decreased? (Increased, no change, declined)\n\nWe will test hypotheses 1 and 2 by comparing outcomes in Group 1 to outcomes in Groups 2 and 2, 3, and 4. We will test hypotheses 3, 4 and 5 by comparing outcomes in Group 3 and Group 4. \n\nOur baseline analysis will be an OLS regression that includes dummy variables for each strata.  In addition, we will run an OLS regression that also includes basic socio-demographic characteristics (age, gender, education, religion, occupation and three need-based measures of household well-being). Finally, we will calculate the complier average treatment effect by using the treatments as instruments for whether the respondent believed (a) aid to the district had increased between 2012 and 2013 and (b) the main recipient of aid was NGOs versus the government.", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": 42430.0, "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "Uganda", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Registration prior to assignment of treatment", "extra": []}, "timestamp": "01/13/2016 - 15:51"}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": 42382.0, "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "This project seeks to understand the effects of \u201cbypass aid\u201d (aid that flows to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), rather than to the government) on the ability and willingness of citizens to hold service providers accountable, the ability and willingness of citizens to hold politicians accountable, and the legitimacy that citizens attach to government institutions.

As a result, by revealing the true source of funding and the true implementing partner to randomly selected citizens, we will be able to change some citizens\u2019 beliefs about the groups responsible for funding and implementing local projects.

We will randomly select households in these polling stations, and then interview either an adult male or an adult female who is at home at the time of the survey within the selected households.  \n\nRespondents in the household survey will be randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups indicated below; the randomization will be stratified by sub-county and gender. \n\n(A1)  No information about project prior to measurement of service accessibility, electoral accountability, and government legitimacy outcomes\n(B1) Information about project but no attribution of responsibility for funding or implementation\n(B2) Information about project and source of funding but no information about implementation\n(B3) Information about project and institution responsible for implementation but no information about funding\n(B4) Information about project, funding source, and institution responsible for implementation\n\nIndividuals assigned to treatment group (A1) will be told nothing about the project until after we have measured the outcome variables related to service accessibility, electoral accountability and government legitimacy and will therefore serve as a pure control. After measuring outcomes, we will tell them about the project only \u2013 as in B1 \u2013 and solicit their beliefs about the funding source and implementing partner at that time.\n\nIndividuals assigned to treatment groups (B1 \u2013 B4) will be told something like this : \n\n\u201cA project to construct a girls' dormitory block at Bukooli College, as well as to construct latrines and provide water tanks, began in this district in 2013. The project cost around 350 million Ugandan shilling, and it occurred in this parish. Here is a photo of the dormitories that were constructed as a result of this project.\u201d\n\nAs indicated, we also will show a photograph of the project in question to the respondents. \n\nImmediately after hearing this information and seeing the image, we will solicit from these individuals their perceptions of the project.  We will ask them:\n\n(1) Before I gave you this information, had you previously heard of this project?\n(2) Who do you think funded the project? \n(3) Who do you think was in charge of managing the funds and using them to run the project?\n\nIndividuals assigned to treatment group (A1) also will receive this information, see the photo, and be asked about their perceptions of the project but only after they already have answered the questions operationalizing our outcome variables related to service accessibility, electoral accountability and government legitimacy. Observations in this cell will be pooled with cell B1 for the purposes of analyzing the outcomes related to the perceptions of project quality and project accountability so long as we do not detect section ordering effects. \n\nFor individuals assigned to treatment group (B1), there is no further treatment, and we will proceed to ask them the outcome questions.  This group, therefore, serves as a control group that has been exposed to information about a project and that has been asked about their views of who funded and implemented the project but that has not been told the true information about funding and implementation.\n\nIndividuals assigned to treatment group (B2) will be told the initial information and asked their beliefs about funding and implementation.  Then they will be given additional information about funding in a form something like this: \n\n\u201cI wanted to give you some additional information about the groups involved in providing the project to construct a girls' dormitory block at Bukooli College, as well as to construct latrines and provide water tanks.\n\nThe Funding for the project came from Japan. Here is a photo of the Japanese ambassador signing off on funding.\u201d\n\nAs indicated, they will see an image of a Japanese official signing a document.  This image will be the same for all projects.\n\nIndividuals assigned to treatment group (B3) will be told the initial information and asked their beliefs about funding and implementation.  Then they will be given additional information about implementation in a form something like this: \n\n\u201cI wanted to give you some additional information about the groups involved in providing the project to construct a girls' dormitory block at Bukooli College, as well as to construct latrines and provide water tanks.\n\nThe organization responsible for managing the projects funds and using them to run the project was the organization Bukooli College. Here is a photo of the signboard for the organization.\u201d\n\nAs indicated, these respondents will see an image representing the implementing organization (i.e., the sign outside the office of the organization).  These images will be collected during interviews with officials from the implementing organizations.\n\nIndividuals assigned to treatment group (B4) will be told the initial information and asked their beliefs about funding and implementation.  Then they will be given additional information about funding and implementation in a form something like this: \n\n\u201cI wanted to give you some additional information about the groups involved in providing the project to construct a girls' dormitory block at Bukooli College, as well as to construct latrines and provide water tanks.\n\nThe Funding for the project came from Japan. Here is a photo of the Japanese ambassador signing off on funding.\n\nThe organization responsible for managing the projects funds and using them to run the project was the organization Bukooli College. Here is a photo of the signboard for the organization.\u201d\n\nAs indicated, respondents in this treatment condition will see both the photo of the Japanese embassy official and of the implementing organization\u2019s signboard.\n\nImportantly, the information revealed in each community will reflect the true funder and the true implementing partner for all projects (i.e., the treatments do not involve deception). Our sample of communities includes only communities with projects funded through the GGP grant-giving mechanism of the Japanese Embassy.  This allows us to hold the funder and the amount of funding for each project constant, while the implementing partner will vary by community.  Prior to conducting the informational intervention, we will conduct elite surveys with (a) the leaders of the organizations that received the grants and (b) LC3 councilors in each of the parishes in which we will conduct the informational intervention. These interviews will be used to guide site selection and to develop the informational prompts. \n\nAfter providing respondents with the informational treatment to which they are assigned, we will ask questions designed to measure our main outcomes of interest. Our main research questions relate to the effect of bypass aid on subjects\u2019 willingness and ability to provide oversight of projects, their evaluations of local politicians and their perceptions of the legitimacy of local government. In addition, we examine the effects of bypass aid on perceptions of project quality and service accessibility.  We indicate the specific questions we will use to measure each outcome in the Outcome Measures section of the attached pre-analysis plan.\n\nFor each of our hypotheses, we are interested in estimating two effects \u2013 the average treatment effect across all subjects and the average treatment effect on compliers (subjects whose information was changed as a result of the informational intervention). \n\nFor example, all subjects may have priors about project funding and project implementation.  They may believe that the project was funded by the national government, the local government, an NGO, a foreign donor, or some other entity \u2013 or they may not know.  They may believe that the project was implemented by the national government, the local government, an NGO, a foreign donor, or some other entity \u2013 or they may not know.  Some people will have correct and certain priors, and some people will have incorrect or uncertain priors. We solicit these priors in all treatment conditions immediately after we describe the project.  For individuals with certain and correct priors, our treatments may still have an effect via priming, but to isolate the priming from the informational effect, we will analyze effects both over the full sample and over the sample with incorrect or diffuse priors.  \n\nSimilarly, some individuals may have the project in mind ex ante and some may not have the project in mind. Our survey also includes a question designed to measure this, and we can examine the effect of information about the project across both the whole sample and the subset of the sample who did not have the project in mind ex ante. \n\nWe will test our hypotheses related to learning about a project by comparing the differences between subjects in the following treatment arms:\nEffect of learning about a project: A1 vs. B1 (B2, B3, B4)\nEffect of learning about a donor-funded project: A1 vs. B2, B4\nEffect of learning about an NGO-implemented project: A1 vs. B3, B4\n\nWe will test our hypotheses related to the differential effects of government-funded versus donor-funded and government-implemented versus NGO-implemented projects by comparing the differences between subjects in the following treatment arms:\nEffect of learning a project was donor-funded: B1 vs. B2, B4\nEffect of learning a project was NGO-implemented: B1 vs. B3, B4\n\nOur main tests will involve running OLS regression analyses with fixed effects for each strata. We will also run OLS regression analyses with controls for basic socio-demographic characteristics (age, gender, education, religion, occupation and three need-based measures of household well-being).  For the electoral accountability outcome measures, we will also include controls for political party identification and past voting behavior.  For the government legitimacy outcome measures, we will control for whether or not the household has paid fees to the local government in the past.

Three short videos for each issue were produced and screened in rural Uganda, where these issues are prominent social concerns.

Many argue that this should have a particularly profound impact in autocracies, where traditional media are often under strict control by the government. With government censorship becoming more difficult in the digital realm, social media are assumed to provide new opportunities for regime-critical discussion, exposure of government abuse, and coordination for collective action. These opportunities, however, have not gone unnoticed by autocratic governments. This is why an emerging literature in comparative politics studies the various ways in which dictators respond to the potential threats arising from the expansion of the Internet. One obvious strategy a regime can employ is to shape digital content in its favor. This can be done either by eliminating unwanted content, or by producing content that is explicitly supportive of the regime. Other approaches autocratic governments can pursue target the underlying network infrastructure. For example, at the height of the Tahir Square protest, Hosni Mubarak of Egypt shut down the country's Internet, supposedly to prevent further escalation. \n\nBoth digital censorship and Internet shutdowns can entail significant risks for dictators: Censorship may be imperfect, such that the regime is unable to eliminate a large share of potentially threatening information. Shutting down the entire infrastructure also has important drawbacks, as it affects not only government opponents but also supporters, while at the same time cutting off Internet services also for government agencies. This is why recent research suggests that autocratic governments can pursue a different strategy: Rather than first providing Internet services and then having to (i) censor them at a high cost or (ii) turn them off entirely, it should be much more beneficial to make the provision of Internet service selective: governments afraid of dissent and mobilization catalyzed by the Internet should be hesitant to provide potential challengers with Internet services. This should significantly reduce the need to censor (since regime-critical content would be less likely to be produced and read), but also the need for large infrastructure shutdowns (since the challengers would be less likely to use the Internet anyway).

There has been a good deal of hand-wringing and debate around how positive \u201caffective orientation\u201d toward a party should be described to and queried of respondents, and applications have ranged from asking for which party respondents \u201cprefer\u201d to which they would call \u201cmy party.\u201d Controversy has also swirled around how to phrase response sets, and particularly whether they should explicitly invite responses of nonpartisanship. Although research on the topic has gone somewhat dormant in recent years, a conventional wisdom seems to be that they should, and virtually all the major cross-national survey data projects have elected to do so. In two population-based survey experiments to be conducted in Mexico, I will assess the impact of question wording on the measure of mass partisanship. In particular, I will evaluate the impact of random manipulations on two different dimensions: the \"attachment descriptor\" (\"preference,\" \"sympathy,\" \"closeness,\" etc.) and the verbal response set.", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": 1200.0, "extra": []}, "id": "20160216AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "D83", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "I plan to conduct two survey experiments embedded within the same questionnaire.\nThe first experiment, which will appear toward the beginning of the questionnaire, will randomize the verbal response set (i.e., the options that are explicitly given to respondents after interviews have read the question stem) while holding the attachment descriptor constant (at \"sympathize\"). There will be three treatments: (1) a verbal labeling/listing of a nonpartisanship option without a verbal labeling of party options, (2) no verbal labeling of either, (3) a verbal labeling of party options without a verbal labeling of a nonpartisanship option. Based on existing best practices in questionnaire design as well as my own findings from similar experiments I conducted in Brazil and Russia, I hypothesize treatment 3 to provide the best discrimination of partisans from nonpartisans. (The primary quantity of interest is the discrimination parameter, which will be measured via item response theory procedures.) I also suspect response set to have an effect on the rates of nonpartisanship and partisanship, with treatment 3 yielding the lowest estimates of nonpartisanship.\nThe second experiment, which will appear toward the end of the questionnaire, will randomize the attachment descriptor while holding the response set constant (at #3) above.

Because of the sensitivity of the election, several organizations sent observer delegations.  With so many different organizations present, the recommendations and observations made by different organizations diverged considerably. Furthermore, one of the most prominent institutions sending observers, the European Union, did not issue its report until late May of 2013, nearly two months after the election and significantly after the promised date. The conflicting assessments and the delay called into question both the impartiality of election monitors and the utility of their pronouncements. It also caused African officials to publicly doubt the validity of non-African election observers sent to the region (Kelley 2013). \n\nThis example and many others like it raises the question: what attributes of election monitoring organizations determine whether domestic actors view a given organization as credible or legitimate (Hyde 2012)? This is germane for international organizations more broadly, but it is a particularly relevant question in the context of international election observer organizations, which countries invite with the very goal of validating their own elections\u2019 legitimacy (Kelley 2008, 230, Hyde 2011). If different organizations make different pronouncements after an election, which organizations do citizens believe? Which assessments do journalists report? Who gains authority and why? \n\nThe question of organizational credibility and legitimacy is particularly interesting in a realm such as election monitoring in which multiple organizations vie for influence in a given election (Kelley 2009). Whether election monitoring organizations are present matters: they can reduce fraud in the polling stations they visit (Hyde 2007). But it also matters which organizations are present, because not all organizations are equally effective (Kelley 2012, Ch. 7). Thus the credibility and perceptions of legitimacy of these organizations matter both for their ability to function and for how citizens and societies weigh their contributions. In this project we examine the sources of credibility for election monitoring organizations, both domestic and international, and for IGOs as well as NGOs. The inclusion of a more varied set of organizations allows us to speak more generally to the sources of credibility and legitimacy, which, at least theoretically, have been posited to have similarities across the international and domestic contexts.\n\nThe next section discusses the sources of credibility and legitimacy and derives a set of general hypotheses. After that, we explain how we use a global experiment on non-governmental organizations to test the hypotheses.

We will send emails to some 14,000 NGOs globally encouraging them to vote in favor of inviting different international governmental organizations (IGOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) involved in election observation to observe the next election in the NGOs\u2019 (respondents\u2019) home countries. We will inform the NGOs that their votes in favor of inviting specific groups will be shared with the election observation organizations so that they can make their decisions on which elections to observe next with fuller information from civil society groups.  Thus, even though this outcome measure is embedded within what is a survey instrument, it is similar to behavioral outcomes in other studies like signing a petition or sending a postcard.  \n\nAfter receiving an email addressed to the NGO, subjects (NGOs) that choose to participate will click on a link to a Qualtrics instrument that will guide them through the survey experiment, which will randomly assign different primes regarding election-monitoring attributes to each participating NGO. The primes will be associated at random with 7 different election observation organizations. Subject NGOs will be able to use the Qualtrics instruments to express support for inviting the election observation organizations one-by-one on a sliding scale from -5 to +5.\n\nAfter the NGO subjects recommend the organizations one-by-one, they will be shown all seven organizations in a list along with summary statements of the priming conditions and asked to assign 100 votes across the 7 organizations. This should enable us to acquire a more nuanced set of revealed preferences for the various organizations potentially affected by the randomly assigned primes.\n\nIt should be noted that this research design is not optimal for testing the heuristic hypotheses. Heuristics are assumed to operate most strongly in the absence of information, but in this case we are actually providing subjects with information about election monitors, so this may dampen or replace any real-world tendency to rely on heuristics. Furthermore, some heuristic conditions, such as level of exposure to an organization (profile) cannot easily be simulated in our design. Telling people that an organization is prominent is not necessarily equivalent to those people having been highly exposed to it in actuality). That said, if the heuristic hypotheses are supported by significant results in this experiment, this should be persuasive.\n\nBefore discussing the experiment and the analysis plan in greater depth, we first discuss the treatment primes.\n\nExperimental Conditions\nFor each respondent, each of eight election observer groups will be randomly assigned one prime that frames a characteristic corresponding to the theorized sources of organizations\u2019 perceived legitimacy outlined above. For each of the following hypotheses and corresponding treatments, the subject will be asked: \u201cPlease move the slider bar into the position that best represents your desire to support or oppose the above-mentioned election observing organization to observe the next election in your country. A score of 5 represents that you strongly support this organization; a score of -5 indicates that you strongly oppose the organization.\u201d\nTwo of the seven statements will be placebo or control as follows:\nControl 1\n \u201cOrganization X actively observes elections. It is an election observing organization that sends a team of observers to report on the general conduct of national elections in different countries.\u201d\nControl 2\n\"Organization X regularly undertakes election observation missions. Through the election period in various countries, trained observers follow up on developments at polling stations and monitor the vote count.\"\n \nThe next section discusses each of the hypotheses and associated treatment language.\nH1. Independence Legitimacy\nMonitors are mandated to render quality assessments by being honest and independent in their assessment (Hyde 2012) and offering constructive suggestions for improvements in the electoral processes, both before and after the elections. That is, monitors may even visit countries before an election and offer recommendations as to how the election is organized. We therefore operationalize performance legitimacy with the following primes. The Independence Treatment focuses on observation organizations\u2019 ability to deliver an independent assessment. All of the organizations used in the experiment endorse the United Nations Declaration of Principles on International Election Observation from which the quoted language is drawn.\nIndependence Treatment\n\u201cOrganization X seeks to be independent in election observation. It professes \u2018to conduct an impartial and professional analysis of ... information; and to draw conclusions about the character of electoral processes based on the highest standards for accuracy of information and impartiality of analysis.\u2019\u201d\n\nH2. Procedural Legitimacy\nThe Procedural Hypothesis states that actors perceive organizations as more legitimate if they operate transparently and consistent with established rules. In the case of election monitoring organizations, procedural legitimacy will be higher for organizations that follow clear rules of election observation as set by international standard and that produce accessible and thorough assessments (Hyde 2012). Such rules would include only observing elections conditional on an invitation from a state, having systematic and transparent ways of recording data, issuing timely reports, and never interfering with the conduct of the election. We therefore operationalize procedural legitimacy with the following prime, again with quoted language drawn from the United Nations Declaration of Principles on International Election Observation:\nProcedural Treatment \n\u201cOrganization X emphasizes proper procedures. It professes to follow \u2018systematic, comprehensive and accurate gathering of information concerning the laws, processes and institutions related to the conduct of elections and other factors concerning the overall electoral environment.\u2019\u201d\nH3: Normative Legitimacy\nThe Normative Hypothesis states that actors perceive organizations as more legitimate if they subscribe to universally accepted values. For election monitoring organizations, normative legitimacy is about the electoral and democratic norms the observers represent and the extent to which people perceive these as converging with international norms. We therefore operationalize procedural legitimacy with the following prime:\nNormative Treatment\n\u201cOrganization X seeks to uphold norms of democracy. It is committed to the idea that the will of the people of a country is the basis for the authority of government, and that will must be determined through genuine periodic elections.\u201d\n\nH4. Profile Legitimacy\nThe Profile Hypothesis states that actors perceive organizations as more legitimate if they are prevalent, if they hear more about them, or if they learn that others consider them as opinion leaders. In the case of election monitoring, people may perceive an organization as more legitimate it is very visible or active or has a long history of operating within a country, or if it is well known for example as evidenced by often being referenced by other organizations, the media, and governments whom citizens may consider appropriate opinion leaders. Name recognition itself may be valuable, even if the organization is known for things other than election monitoring.  We therefore operationalize prevalence legitimacy with the following primes. \nProfile Treatment \n\u201cOrganization X is well known. It is one of the most widely recognized election observation organizations based on coverage by international media and attention on the internet.\u201d \nH5. Isomorphic Legitimacy\nThe Isomorphism Hypothesis states that actors perceive organizations as more legitimate if they invoke identification based on geography, language or culture. For international election monitoring, this means that people are more likely to perceived organizations as legitimate if they are more local or indigenous. Regional organizations may therefore be seen as more legitimate than global, or western, ones. An example of this occurred when, in March 2013, former Nigeria president, Olusegun Obasanjo gave a keynote address at the 7th Annual symposium of the Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa (EISA) in Johannesburg, and argued that \u201cnon-African election observer missions should be banned from monitoring polls in the continent,\u201d because they \u201cwere sometimes biased and that their position sometimes seemed to undermine the sovereignty of African countries.\u201d  We therefore operationalize Isomorphic Legitimacy with the following primes for regional compard to global organizations:\nIsomorphism treatments\nRegional\n\u201cOrganization X is headquartered in [regional capital] and operates in [region]. \n Global\n\u201cOrganization X is headquartered in [foreign capital] and operates globally.\n\nAmendment to Protocol\nThis is an amendment to the prior protocol submitted in November of 2015. Nearly all of the research design elements are identical to the original study. However, in an additional round of survey experiments, a new subject pool of roughly 30,000 NGOs (drawn from the World Association of Non-Governmental Organizations) will be randomly assigned to two different experimental arms. The first arm is identical to that described above in the November 2015 protocol. \n\nThe second arm, however, rather than assigning subjects initially to assess the credibility of actual electoral observation groups instead will be asked to evaluate hypothetical groups with names removed, so \u201cOrganization A,\u201d \u201cOrganization B,\u201d etc. All of the priming treatment language is identical across treatment arms. Randomly assigned hypothetical conditions also include whether the organization is a \u201cprivate organization without government involvement\u201d or an \u201cinternational organization managed by governments.\u201d The headquarters of the hypothetical organization is also randomly assigned as being in Europe, America, Africa, or Asia. After subjects rate the credibility of the hypothetical organizations, they are given the opportunity to express support for actual organizations by name without additional descriptions. All language and design features, including outcomes of interest, are otherwise identical across the two treatment arms.  \nOutcomes of Interest\nThe Qualtrics platform will prompt subject NGOs to provide two different types of recommended invitations to the election monitors:\n\n1. NGO level of support, -5 to 5 -point scale from least to most favored for an invitation to observe the NGOs\u2019 home countries\u2019 next elections. The order in which the organizations are presented will be randomized along with the priming statement for each of the factors that we hypothesize will drive legitimacy perceptions.\n2.

After the initial questions about endorsements based on randomly assigned priming states, subjects will be shown the list of the organizations along with summaries of the priming statements in random order and be invited to assign a number of votes summing to 100 to each of the organizations. Subjects will see the following statement:\n\n\u201cCommunicating Your Voice\nWe are interested in your organization\u2019s opinion about which international election observation groups should be invited to observe the next national elections in your country. Below you will find a list of seven different election observation groups that could potentially be invited to observe the next elections along with brief information about each group.  In order to communicate how strongly you feel about which organizations should be invited, you are given 100 \u201cvotes\u201d to cast across the seven groups. More votes mean that you feel more strongly that the group should be invited. The 100 votes may be cast in any way you choose across the organizations listed. You can give all your votes to one organization or give some votes to several organizations. It is okay for some organizations to receive no votes.\n \nThe rankings will enable us to convey which organizations you think should be invited and to provide more detailed information about the strength of your opinions to the election observation organizations.\u201d\n\nIt is important to note here that the relative level of endorsement received by each of the election monitoring organizations compared to the others will not affect the results in expectation. Each organization serves as its own control, and the treatment effects should thus reflect the relative causal influence of each of the priming statements on NGO support for each organization compared to the placebo statements. We included two placebo conditions to help improve statistical power given the multiple comparisons planned.\n\nWe will randomly assign the five treatment statements plus two placebos such that each subject sees one of the seven statements associated with each of the seven organizations on the list, one-by-one. In the guided Qualtrics survey instrument, subjects will first be invited to rate the specific organization on the -5 to 5-point scale. Next, subjects will then be shown all seven organizations along with the prompts and asked to distribute the 100 votes. \n\nNote that we will not be manipulating the attributes of the organizations per se, since those features are in a real sense already set. But we will be manipulating primes or salient information about the features by providing different prompts. The priming effects, while potentially different from the actual underlying sources of legitimacy and credibility, should nevertheless still be consistent with the theory of legitimacy that we have augmented above. This should give us a relative ranking of treatment effects of information regarding the posited sources of legitimacy. \n\nThe level of endorsement may give us some separation across the treatments and placebo, but the 100-point voting for the election observer organizations should be an even more sensitive measure that ought to capture relative legitimacy of each election observer organization and, on average, the effects the treatments have on the relative rankings. For example, if the independence statement induces more public endorsement and a higher ranking for the EU compared to the placebo, then we might conclude that information about independence in some sense causes improved legitimacy or credibility.\n\nSubject Pool\nThe experiment will be performed on more than 14,000 NGOs involved in international development drawn from the Directory of Development Organizations. Many NGOs will choose not to participate in the study \u2013 indeed, our prior experiments with subjects from this database suggest that the base rate expected for the response proportion will be relatively low (roughly five percent). Nevertheless, since each subject will be making 7 endorsements each and also completing the 100-point voting for each organization, we should have sufficient power to detect meaningful treatment effects. \n\nThe selected international observers organizations for NGOs in each global region are listed below and their assignments are indicated in the table. These organizations were selected to obtain a set of realistic actors that spanned a variety of regional and global origins and that might plausibly observe elections in given countries given their regional affiliation. \nAmendment to Protocol\nIn addition to the 14,000 NGOs employed in the November 2015 study, an additional study was undertaken employing two treatment arms \u2013 hypothetical organizations and real organizations \u2013 as described in the amendment section above. The new study was conducted on roughly 30,000 NGOs drawn from the World Association of Non-Governmental Organizations. Contact of subjects and administration of the survey experiment was otherwise identical to the November 2015 design. This amendment was registered before researchers had access to the additional data.\nOrganizations:\nCarter: The Carter Center\nNDI: National Democratic Institute\nIRI: International Republican Institute\nDI: Democracy International\nIEMI: International Election Monitors Institute\nEU: European Union\nOAS: Organization of American States\nCARICOM: Caribbean Community and Common Market\nPIANZEA: Pacific Islands, Australia and New Zealand Electoral Administrators Network\nANFREL: Asian Network for Free Elections\nOSCE: Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\nCoE: Council of Europe\nAU: African Union\n\n\u2003\n\nRegion 1st Grp 2nd Grp 3rd Grp 4th Grp 5th Grp 6th Grp 7th Grp\nAmericas Carter NDI IRI DI IEMI EU OAS\nCaribbean Carter NDI IRI DI IEMI EU CARICOM\nOceania Carter NDI IRI DI IEMI EU PIANZEA\nAsia Carter NDI IRI DI IEMI EU ANFREL\nEurope EU Carter NDI IRI DI IEMI OSCE CoE\nNon-EU Europe & Central Asia Carter NDI IRI DI IEMI EU OSCE\nAfrica Carter NDI IRI DI IEMI EU AU\n\nRandomization Scheme\n\nSince each organization will be its own control in that the given NGO (respondent) sees all conditions in the experiment, we should not need to block randomize. \n\nPower Analysis\nPower analysis was conducted assuming a power of .8 and a significance level of .05.

We will follow the procedures described below. \n\nIn the good institutions condition,\n(1) Participants are given the information about the game including that they will complete a clerical task, pay taxes into a common pot, and that the common pot will be evenly redistributed to all participants at the end of the game.  Their compensation will depend on how well they complete the task, how they play the game, how others play the game, and chance.  Specifically, they will be paid a specific amount of experimental currency units (ECU) for every line of numbers entered and these ECUs will be converted into dollars at the end of the game.  \n(2) There will be one practice round of the clerical task where all students are employed.  Participants will first be asked to vote for their preferred tax rate; the preferred tax rate is considered to be their redistributive preference and is our main dependent variable of interest.  We will emphasize that the size of the tax rate determines how large the common pot is which then gets distributed to all participants at the end of each round.  In the practice round, their performance will not determine their compensation.  For the practice rounds, participants will complete the task and be updated with a list of pre- and post-tax earnings with individuals ranked from high to low productivity and their own position highlighted.  This mimics the procedures for the subsequent actual rounds of the game. \n(3) Next, we hold several rounds of the actual game.  First, participants will first find out if they were randomly assigned to be unemployed and will receive this message on their computer screen.  Unemployed students will be asked to wait for this round to end and informed that this does not mean they will necessarily be unemployed in future rounds of the game.\n(4) Tax Rate 1 (3 rounds of clerical task): Participants will vote on a preferred tax rate for the first time.  The actual tax rate will be the median tax rate for which participants vote.  Participants will complete 3 rounds of the clerical task.  Each round some participants will be randomly assigned to be unemployed or not.  At the end of all 3 rounds, participants are updated with the information from the previous 3 rounds.  This includes pre- and post-tax earnings, the productivity of all participants, and where their own productivity lies.\n(5) Tax Rate 2 (3 rounds of clerical task): Participants will vote on a preferred tax rate for the second time.  The actual tax rate will be the median tax rate for which participants vote.  Participants will complete 3 rounds of the clerical task.  Each round some participants will be randomly assigned to be unemployed or not.  At the end of all 3 rounds, participants are updated with the information from the previous 3 rounds.  This includes pre- and post-tax earnings, the productivity of all participants, and where their own productivity lies. \n(6) Tax Rate 3 (3 rounds of clerical task): Participants will vote on a preferred tax rate for the third and final time.  The actual tax rate will be the median tax rate for which participants vote.  Participants will complete 3 rounds of the clerical task.  Each round some participants will be randomly assigned to be unemployed or not.  \n(7) At the end of all of the rounds, participants will complete a short survey including questions about social trust and an incentivized risk question (a short gambling game). \n\nIn the first tax evasion treatment (uniform audit risk) of the game:\n(1) As above, participants are given the basic information about how the game is played.\n(2) Unlike the good institutions scenario described above, participants will additionally be told they can choose what percentage of their earnings to report at the end of the round. Taxes will only be paid on reported income and all individuals face a low probability (10%) of being audited.  Audited individuals who have under-reported their income must pay a fee of 2 times the amount which they hid.  These funds are not placed into the social policy pool for future redistribution.  We will truthfully inform individuals that the probability of audit is the same across individuals and exogenous.  That is, it does not depend on the percentage of earnings reported or productivity.  Subjects will be allowed to choose to report any percentage of their earnings between 0% and 100%.  Participants will not know how many rounds they will be playing, but they will be informed beforehand that we will be updating them with information about how much each participant earns, how much each person pays in taxes, and the extent of underreporting.  They will be told that this information will be anonymized (they will not know who earned or reported certain amounts).  \n(8) Practice round as described above.\n(3) Next, we hold several rounds of the actual game.  \na. Tax Rate 1 (3 rounds of clerical task): Participants will vote on a preferred tax rate for the first time.  The actual tax rate will be the median tax rate for which participants vote.  Participants will complete 3 rounds of the clerical task.  Each round some participants will be randomly assigned to be unemployed or not.  At the end of all 3 rounds, participants are updated with the information from the previous 3 rounds.  This includes pre- and post-tax earnings, the productivity of all participants, their own productivity, and the rate of actual cheating in the previous three rounds.  Participants will be asked to choose what percentage of income to report and reminded that there is a uniform and low risk of audit that is not linked to how much they earned or how much income they choose to report.  \nb. Tax Rate 2 (3 rounds of clerical task): Participants will vote on a preferred tax rate for the second time.  The actual tax rate will be the median tax rate for which participants vote.  Participants will complete 3 rounds of the clerical task.  Each round some participants will be randomly assigned to be unemployed or not.  At the end of these 3 rounds, participants are updated with the information from the previous 3 rounds.  This includes pre- and post-tax earnings, the productivity of all participants, their own productivity, and the rate of actual cheating in the previous three rounds.  Participants will be asked to choose what percentage of income to report and reminded that there is a uniform and low risk of audit that is not linked to how much they earned or how much income they choose to report.   \nc. Tax Rate 3 (3 rounds of clerical task): Participants will vote on a preferred tax rate for the third and final time.  The actual tax rate will be the median tax rate for which participants vote.  Participants will complete 3 rounds of the clerical task.  Each round some participants will be randomly assigned to be unemployed or not.  \n(4) At the end of all of the rounds, participants will complete a short survey including questions about social trust and an incentivized risk question (a short gambling game). \n\nIn the second tax evasion treatment (variable audit risk) of the game:\n(1) As above, participants are given the basic information about how the game is played.\n(2) Unlike the scenarios described above, participants will also be told they will be allowed to decide what percentage of their earnings to report at the end of the round as in the first tax cheating treatment. This time, however, probability of being audited will be either 10 or 70% (participants will have a 50/50 chance of being assigned either risk of audit).  Each participant will have the same risk of audit throughout all of the rounds below.  Those who are audited and caught under-reporting their income will pay the tax plus a fine equal to the amount of the tax. Note that the common pot is only funded by reported income and even if participants are caught underreporting, the penalty will not go into the common pot.  The idea is to see how different risks of audit influence individual rates of cheating and how the differing risks of audit interact with other individual level characteristics (especially productivity) to influence preferences for redistribution.  Again, participants will be truthfully informed that audit risk is exogenous and not tied to income or how much they underreport.\n(3) Practice round as described above.  Everyone is employed in the practice round, tax evasion will be allowed to let participants see how that works, and participants will receive the information about pre and post income.\n(4) Next, we will hold several rounds of the actual game.  \na. Tax Rate 1 (3 rounds of clerical task): Participants will vote on a preferred tax rate for the first time.  The actual tax rate will be the median tax rate for which participants vote.  Participants will complete 3 rounds of the clerical task.  Each round some participants will be randomly assigned to be unemployed or not.  At the end of all 3 rounds, participants are updated with the information from the previous 3 rounds.  This includes pre- and post-tax earnings, the productivity of all participants, their own productivity, and the rate of actual underreporting in the previous three rounds.  Participants will be asked to choose what percentage of income to report and reminded that there is a uniform and low risk of audit that is not linked to how much they earned or how much income they choose to report.  \nb. Tax Rate 2 (3 rounds of clerical task): Participants will vote on a preferred tax rate for the second time.  The actual tax rate will be the median tax rate for which participants vote.  Participants will complete 3 rounds of the clerical task.  Each round some participants will be randomly assigned to be unemployed or not.  At the end of these 3 rounds, participants are updated with the information from the previous 3 rounds.  This includes pre- and post-tax earnings, the productivity of all participants, their own productivity, and the rate of actual underreporting in the previous three rounds.  Participants will be asked to choose what percentage of income to report and reminded that there is a uniform and low risk of audit that is not linked to how much they earned or how much income they choose to report.   \nc. Tax Rate 3 (3 rounds of clerical task): Participants will vote on a preferred tax rate for the third and final time.  The actual tax rate will be the median tax rate for which participants vote.  Participants will complete 3 rounds of the clerical task.  Each round some participants will be randomly assigned to be unemployed or not.  \n(5) At the end of all of the rounds, participants will complete a short survey including questions about social trust and an incentivized risk question. \n\nNote that it is important for this to be played as a game in which there are real consequences for a person\u2019s compensation depending on how she and other group members play.  There is evidence that simply setting up a hypothetical scenario will not produce realistic results.  The game is designed to mimic a realistic situation in which there is a risk of unemployment and individuals vary in their productivity.\n\n************\n\nSurvey questions\n\n\u2022 Risk aversion (gambling game): asked before any of the other parts of the experiment\n\u2022 Socioeconomic questions (age, marital status, education, income, employment, current employer, current position)\n\u2022 Government spending preferences (8 different categories)\n\u2022 Government responsibility preferences (7 different categories)\n\u2022 Degree to which an individual is law-abiding\n\u2022 Social trust\n\u2022 Perception of institutions (how fair do you think the system is)\no 5 categories of answers from strongly disagree to strongly agree with a \u201chard to say\u201d answer\no Several Statements\n\uf0a7 Politicians typically follow through on their policy promises.\n\uf0a7 Government policies change frequently.\n\uf0a7 Most people pay their taxes.\n\uf0a7 Government officials can generally be relied upon to follow laws.\n\uf0a7 It is easy to get the state-provided benefits to which I am entitled.\n\uf0a7 Government officials are typically corrupt. \n", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "United States, Russia", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Registration prior to realization of outcomes", "extra": []}, "timestamp": "02/25/2016 - 16:02"}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": 42370.0, "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "We use event data from the World-Wide Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS) to forecast the onset of civil war over 1-month and 6-month windows.

In response to these challenges, between 2007 and 2014, the IRC and CARE International carried out the Tuungane program.  Tuungane is a community driven development (CDD) program, which is a widely applied and growing form of intervention that takes a bottom-up approach to designing and implementing development projects. Funded by the United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID), the program went through two phases. The first, \u00a330 million phase of the program \u201cTuungane 1\u201d (T1) operated between 2007 and 2011. The second, \u00a360 million phase of the program, \u201cTuungane 2\u201d (T2), was carried out between 2011 and 2014. T1 aimed to support local governance, social cohesion and economic recovery in 1,250 randomly selected Village Development Committee (VDC) areas, and 280 Community Development Committee (CDC) areas. T2 continued to apply the CDD approach and worked in 1,025 VDCs in the same provinces as Tuungane 1 with the addition of North Kivu. These communities, however, were not randomly selected.\n\nHumphreys, Sanchez and Van der Windt (2012) - HSW (2012) - explored the impact of a subset of T1 activities (the data collection for that study took place between 2010 and 2012). The evaluation found no evidence that Tuungane had an effect on the stated goals of improving economic and social outcomes. The evaluation proposed here moves beyond HSW (2012) in four important ways. First, HSW (2012) focused solely on a subset of T1 activities (the so-called VDC component). HSW (2012) do not capture the effects of the \u201cCDC component\u201d, which accounts financially for the largest share of the T1 envelope and involves a significant infrastructure project per CDC area. Second, HSW (2012) placed primary emphasis on the impact of the VDC component on governance outcomes. In this study, we investigate if the program had an impact on service provision, and education, health and economic outcomes. Third, we know little about the long-term impacts of CDD programs. Previous studies, including HSW (2012), were conducted shortly after the end of the CDD program. It is possible that very different estimates might have been produced if data were gathered several years later. This evaluation is set to take place around five years after T1 was implemented. Finally, one possible explanation for the lack of evidence (or at best mixed evidence) found in favor of the CDD model is that the assumptions and pathways of change underpinning the theory of change for CDD programs are wrong. This study incorporates a qualitative component that explores the extent to which the assumptions and mechanisms underpinning Tuungane\u2019s theory of change are warranted.\n\nPlease see Section 1 (pages 3-7) in the attached PAP for more information.", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "Data will be collected in 842 communities ", "extra": []}, "id": "20160315AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "F35, I15, I25, N37", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "For the first phase of Tuungane (2007-2011) we test the following primary hypotheses:\nH1 T1 led to improvement in service provision\nH2 T1 had a positive impact on health outcomes\nH3 T1 had a positive impact on education outcomes\nH4 T1 had a positive impact on welfare\nH5 T1 had a heterogeneous impact by improvements in service provision\nH6 T1 had a heterogeneous impact by gender parity\n\nAnd the following secondary hypotheses:\nH7 T1 had a positive impact on governance\nH8 T1 had a positive impact on women empowerment\nH9 T1 had a positive impact on intra-village cohesion\nH10 T1 had a positive impact on inter-village cohesion\nH11 T1 had a heterogeneous impact by type of community\nH12 T1 had a heterogeneous impact by type of project\nH13 T1 has inflated prices in the community\n\nFor the second phase of Tuungane (2011-2014) we have not set out hypotheses.

For example, although Roma populations in Greece have been legally integrated through the extension of citizenship, they continue to live on the margins of society, economically and socially segregated from the majority ethnic Greek population because of sustained discrimination. \n\nThe example of Greece highlights an interesting paradox. The humanitarian, public policy, and academic communities have long held that the extension of legal rights to vulnerable migrants will ease their economic, social, and political integration, bolstering living standards and quality of life. According to this logic, we would expect that providing access to legal rights, in turn, changes the broader community's perceptions of this marginalized out-group. However, in Greece, we see the power of sustained out-group prejudice outweighing the expected effect of extension of legal rights. This begs the question of whether out-group prejudice decrease when paired with a normative assertion about the international legal rights of the marginalized out-group. \n\nAs such, this research project examines Greeks\u2019 generosity as a function of the ethnic identity of aid recipients. As a secondary experiment, we also examine whether a reference to fundamental rights can reduce out-group prejudice (in terms of generosity). To do so, we are working with Prolepsis, a Greek NGO, and major mobile carriers in Greece to conduct a nationwide SMS text message experiment from March 25th to 29th, 2016. \n\nThis study offers the first rigorous experimental approach to examining ethnic Greeks\u2019 generosity towards out-groups--particularly, toward their highly stigmatized and often segregated Roma populations.

Even more importantly, this study contributes to the understanding of when pleas to aid a vulnerable out-group are effective. We thereby actually measure behavioral change, examining whether a reminder employing the language of fundamental rights (i. e., \u201cEvery child has a right to food\u201d) can reduce out-group prejudice. In sum, the most innovative element of this research is project is that we can actually \noperationalize out-group prejudice (via discrepancies in respondents\u2019 willingness to donate one Euro) and then measure behavioral changes (examining whether this discrepancy is reduced when we invoke a normative frame of legal rights).

Anecdotally, this policy is unpopular in the field, suggesting that aid agency staff and especially foreign aid grantees in the field do not see much benefit in it.  So why does the policy of requiring branding of aid projects persist?  One possibility is that this policy is really intended to reach domestic audiences within the donor countries, and to encourage donor publics to see the strategic value of aid.   This research focuses on several related questions: How do donor public view aid different when they know that aid recipients are told that they are receiving assistance, for example, from the British people?  Does it improve their attitudes towards the utility of foreign aid?  Does emphasizing the strategic or instrumental benefits of aid (i.e. that donors are trying to look good in addition to doing good deeds) change attitudes about the efficacy of aid projects within the donor country?  In many countries public opinion about foreign aid is relatively negative, and citizens generally overestimate how much money is dedicated to aid.  Previous studies, however, have shown that these opinions about foreign aid are possible to manipulate with more information.  How much does information about the instrumental value of foreign aid (i.e., the possibility that it will improve attitudes toward the donor in recipient countries) affect people\u2019s attitudes about foreign aid?  In a relatively subtle way, we give people the opportunity to see the instrumental value of aid (i.e., by showing them branding in action in the field) \u2013 do they actually infer that instrumental usefulness?  We also can directly tell people about the instrumental intentions of branding.  If we do this, does it decrease people\u2019s perceptions of the development effectiveness of the aid?  These questions get at Morgenthau\u2019s (1962) fundamental discussion of the twin purposes of aid and the tension between them. In this pilot study (using three University-based subject pools in the UK) respondents will be shown a short video about a UKAID funded project in Bangladesh called the Smiling Sun Clinic.

This variable combines questions about Holocaust denial and conspiracy theories related to Jewish world domination, the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and the Islamic State/ISIS:\n\n\u2013 The United States is secretly trying to help the Islamic State (ISIS) take power in Syria and Iraq.\n\u2013 Abu Bakr Al-Bagdadi, the leader of the Islamic State (ISIS), is an Israeli intelligence agent.\n\u2013 Millions of Jews died in the Holocaust in Europe during World War II.\n\u2013 The number of Jews who died in the Holocaust has been greatly exaggerated.\n\u2013 The United States is trying to destroy the Islamic State (ISIS).\n\u2013 Jewish leaders are secretly conspiring to achieve world domination.\n\u2013 Arabs carried out the attacks against the United States (the World Trade Center and the Pentagon) on September 11, 2001.\n\u2013 Jews carried out the September 11, 2001 attacks against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the United States.\n\nWe will take the mean of these eight outcome measures which are measured on a four-point scale from \"Very accurate\" to \"Not at all accurate\" after reverse-coding as appropriate so that higher values indicate greater misperceptions. If the questions used for this measure scale together using principal components factor analysis, we will create a composite measure of conspiracy and misperception belief and use it as our primary outcome measure. However, regardless of how well the questions scale together, we will also analyze responses to each question separately and group them by the misperception or conspiracy in question - i.e., 9/11, Holocaust/Jewish conspiracy, and ISIS. (Note: Though we will analyze the component questions of our primary outcome measure using principal component factor analysis, we will construct any combined outcome measure as a mean for ease of interpretation.) \n\nWe will also examine three secondary outcome measures: 1) attitudes towards democracy, 2) sympathy with individuals who fight for the Islamic State, and 3) and a post-treatment measure of anti-Western attitudes. \n\nFirst, we will construct a composite measure of attitudes toward democracy using the four measures of support for democracy below plus the question about the trade-off between security and stability. Each will be measured on a four-point scale from \"Strongly agree\" to \"Strongly disagree\" after reverse-coding as appropriate so that higher values indicate greater opposition to democracy. (If the questions used for this measure do not scale together, we may analyze them separately or consider a subset.)\n\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statements?\n\u2013  In a democracy, the economy runs badly\n\u2013  Democracies are indecisive and have too much quibbling\n\u2013  Democracies are not good at maintaining order\n\u2013  Democracy is a Western form of government which is not compatible with Islam\n\nPlease indicate whether you agree or disagree with the following statement: Respect for human rights in (Egypt/Saudia Arabia) is important, but promoting security and stability is more important.\n\nSympathy for fighters in the Islamic State will be measured based on responses to the following question, which is again measured on a four-point scale from \"Strongly agree\" to \"Strongly disagree\" so that higher values indicate greater sympathy.\n\nPlease indicate whether you agree or disagree with the following statement: Even though I don't agree with everything they do, I can understand why someone would go to fight for the Islamic State.\n\nFinally, we will create a composite measure of anti-Western attitudes using responses to the questions below after response-coding as appropriate so that higher values indicate greater anti-Western attitudes. (If the questions used for this measure do not scale together, we may analyze each of them separately.)\n\nWhich comes closer to describing your view?\n\u2013  Western music, movies, and television have hurt morality in our country\n\u2013  Western music, movies and television have NOT hurt morality in our country\n\nWhich of these characteristics do you associate with people in Western countries such as the United\nStates and Europe?\n\u2013  Selfish\n\u2013  Respectful of women\n\u2013  Tolerant\n\u2013  Honest\n\u2013  Generous\n\u2013  Violent\n\u2013  Greedy\n\u2013  Immoral\n\u2013  Arrogant\n\nResponse options:\n\u2013  Yes, associate\n\u2013  No, do not associate\n\u2013  Don't know\n\nBoth attitudes towards democracy and our post-treatment measure of anti-Western attitudes will be analyzed and constructed using principal components factor analysis, which allows for differential weights and also accounts for differing numbers of response options. Because sympathy with individuals who fight for the Islamic State is only one question, we will analyze responses to that measure directly.\n\nStatistical analyses\n\nFor each of our analyses, we will use OLS with robust standard errors. Unless otherwise noted, all experimental treatment effects will be estimated as intent to treat effects.  \n\nOur primary model will be pooled regressions for respondents from Egypt and Saudi Arabia with country fixed effects, but we will also estimate pooled regressions fully interacting the country of the respondent with our main explanatory variables. If we cannot reject the null of no difference between countries, we will present the pooled model. If the effects of key explanatory variables differ between countries, we will present separate models by country in the main text for expositional clarity and present interactive models in an appendix. We will estimate marginal effects as appropriate when interaction terms are included in our models. (We will also estimate our treatment effect models with standard demographic controls that include demographic controls for age, sex, religion (Egyptian Coptic Christians), socioeconomic status, education, and an indicator for non-citizen residents of Saudi Arabia along with country fixed effects and report them if the treatment effect estimate is substantively different from the model only including country fixed effects.)\n\nFor H1, we estimate the correlation between pre-treatment anti-Western attitudes and conspiracy and misperception belief in a model that controls for fixed effects as well as demographic controls for age, sex, religion (Egyptian Coptic Christians), socioeconomic status, education, and an indicator for non-citizen residents of Saudi Arabia. To measure anti-Western attitudes, we will analyze responses to the following pre-treatment questions using principal component factor analysis and construct a composite measure as a factor score:\n\nPlease indicate if you have a very favorable, somewhat favorable, somewhat unfavorable or very\nunfavorable opinion of each of the countries listed below. \n\u2013  United States\n\u2013  Israel\n\u2013  United Kingdom\n\nHow favorable or unfavorable is your opinion of the following groups? \n\u2013  Jews\n\u2013  Christians\n\u2013  Americans\n\nIf the country or group-based measures of anti-Western attitudes do not scale well together, we will analyze each group separately, considering attitudes towards Christians, Jews, Americans, the US, the UK, and Israel separately. (We will also evaluate RQ3a using this model, which allows us to estimate whether belief in conspiracy theories and misperceptions differs between respondents in Egypt and Saudi Arabia conditional on the observable characteristics described above. We will also estimate a version of the model in which we omit the control, religion, socioeconomic status, and education variables, which are arguably post-treatment for country-level difference. If the results are substantively different in this model, we will report it instead.)\n\nFor RQ1, we will estimate the same model as H1 but also interact our measure of pre-treatment anti-Western attitudes with either a measure of political knowledge or a measure of respondent education in separate models. The knowledge score will be computed as the sum of correct answers to the following battery measuring both current and historical political knowledge:\n\nWhich country is Bashar al-Assad the leader of?\n\u2013  Syria\n\u2013  Iraq\n\u2013  Iran\n\u2013  Jordan\n\nWho is the Supreme Leader of Iran?\n\u2013  Hassan Rouhani\n\u2013  Saddam Hussein\n\u2013  Sayyid Ali Khamenei\n\u2013  Hamid Karzai\n\nWho is the prime minister of the United Kingdom?\n\u2013  David Cameron\n\u2013  Tony Blair\n\u2013  Barack Obama\n\u2013  Angela Merkel\n\nWhich country first used the atomic bomb?\n\u2013  Japan\n\u2013  Germany\n\u2013  Soviet Union\n\u2013  United States of America\n\nWhich country tore down a wall and reunified itself after the end of the Cold War?\n\u2013  Germany\n\u2013  Cuba\n\u2013  Poland\n\u2013  South Africa\n\nWhich leader helped India achieve independence from Britain in 1947?\n\u2013  Mahatma Gandhi\n\u2013  Benazir Bhutto\n\u2013  Manmohan Singh\n\u2013  Narendra Modi\n\nWe will analyze responses to the knowledge scale using factor analysis and construct separate current events and historical knowledge scale measures if two subscales do not scale well together. The education measure will be provided by YouGov from their panel demographics.\n\nFor H2a, we estimate the correlation between self-reported feelings of control and conspiracy and misperception belief in a model that controls for fixed effects as well as demographic controls for age, sex, religion (Egyptian Coptic Christians), socioeconomic status, education, and an indicator for non-citizen residents of Saudi Arabia. To measure feelings of control, we will analyze responses to the following pre-treatment questions on a four-point agree/disagree scale using principal components factor analysis and construct a composite measure as a factor score:\n\n-I can solve the problems I have.\n-I sometimes feel I am being pushed around.\n-I have little control over what happens to me.\n-I can do just about anything I really set my mind to.\n-I often feel helpless in dealing with the problems of life.\n-What happens to me in the future depends mostly on me.\n-There is little I can do to change important things in my life.\n\n(If the items do not scale well together, we may instead construct the control measure using a subset of items with better measurement properties.)\n\nFor H2b and RQ2, we will use OLS with robust standard errors to estimate the effects of the low control manipulation on our composite measure of conspiracy and misperception belief. The effect of the low control manipulation will be estimated relative to both the high control manipulation (for H2b) and the placebo (for RQ2). The model will be specified as y=b0+b1*low_control+b2*high_control+b3*saudi_arabia. We will then compute the low control effect as b2-b1 for H2 and examine b1 for RQ2. (We may also estimate the model with the standard set of demographic covariates described above in addition to the KSA fixed effect if including those demographic measures has a substantively important effect on the precision of our treatment effect estimate but in that case both models will be reported.)\n\nIn evaluating these findings and H3a/H3b, we will also consider the effects of the treatment on our manipulation check measure:\n\nSome people feel they have completely free choice and control over their lives, while other people feel that what they do has no real control over what happens to them. In general, how much control do you feel you have over what happens in your life?\n-No control\n-Very little control\n-Some control\n-Quite a bit of control\n-A great deal of control\n-Total control\n\nThis outcome variable will be evaluated using the same model/approach as H2b and RQ2. If the treatment has the expected effect, it may increase people's reported feelings of control. However, we are not confident that the treatment will necessarily affect this measure. It is possible that people who feel less in control after the manipulation may seek to alleviate that uncomfortable feeling by reasserting their feelings of control over their life. We will therefore use the manipulation check to provide context to our main tests of H2b and RQ2 described above.\n\nIf the low control manipulation has a large and statistically significant effect on our post-treatment measure of self-reported feelings of control (i.e., meets the criteria for a strong instrument), we will also estimate an instrumental variables regression that uses assignment to the low control condition as an instrument for post-treatment self-reported feelings of control. We will then estimate a local average treatment effect (LATE) of variation in feelings of control for people whose feelings of control were affected by the experimental manipulation. \n\nFor H3a, we estimate whether the association between pre-treatment self-reported feelings of control and conspiracy and misperception belief is moderated by pre-treatment anti-Western attitudes in a model that also controls for fixed effects as well as demographic controls for age, sex, religion (Egyptian Coptic Christians), socioeconomic status, education, and an indicator for non-citizen residents of Saudi Arabia. (This model will again use the measures of feelings of control and anti-Western attitudes constructed according to the procedure described above for H2a and H1, respectively.)\n\nFor H3b, we will estimate a similar model to H2b but interact our indicators for our low and high control conditions with our measure of pre-treatment anti-Western attitudes as used in H1. We will use this interaction to see if the effect of our treatments on conspiracy and misperception belief is moderated by anti-Western attitudes. The model will be specified as y=b0+b1*low_control+b2*high_control+b3*anti_Western_attitudes+b4*low_controlXanti_western+b5*high_controlXanti_western+b6*saudi_arabia. We will then compute the marginal effect of low versus high control over the range of anti-Western attitudes using a procedure similar to that described in Brambor et al. 2006 but implementing the robustness checks and recommendations of Hainmeuller et al. (N.d.). (Note: We may again estimate the model with the standard set of demographic covariates described above in addition to the KSA fixed effect if including those demographic measures has a substantively important effect on the precision of our treatment effect estimate but in that case both models will be reported.)\n \nTo test RQ3b, we will also evaluate whether the effect of reminders of feelings of low control on belief in conspiracy theories and misperceptions differs between respondents in Egypt and Saudi Arabia (compared to respondents in the high control condition). This model will be specified as y=b0+b1*low_control+b2*high_control+b3*saudi_arabia+b4*low_controlXsaudi_arabia+b5*high_controlXsaudi_arabia. We will estimate the marginal effect of low control (versus high) for both Egypt and Saudia Arabia and also evaluate whether the difference between the marginal effects is statistically significant.\n \nFinally, our analyses for RQ4a-RQ4c will repeat the analysis described above for H2b but with the dependent variable as attitudes towards democracy (RQ4a), sympathy for fighting for the Islamic State (RQ4b), and attitudes toward the West (RQ4c), which will be measured as described above.\n\n(All results will be unweighted. Regression results for individual ordered dependent variables will be verified for robustness using ordered probit.

The political calculus behind such carve-outs is clear - the reformers hope they will make the reforms more palatable to the politically active seniors who depend on them.  But does this political strategy actually work?  More broadly, do older Americans respond to appeals to self-interest in Social Security and Medicare proposals?  These questions are relevant not just to policy debates, but to an important debate in the academic literature between scholars who argue for the importance of self-interest and those who emphasize sociotropic or symbolic concerns over self-interest in the formation of policy attitudes.  One of the central difficulties in resolving this debate is the difficulty in distinguishing between true, narrow self-interest and a more altruistic concern for other citizens with whom an individual identifies (i.e., \"people like me\").  \n\nIn this study, I use an innovative survey experiment that exploits both experimental variation and respondent birth date to produce a reliable estimate of a self-interest effect in older Americans' attitudes toward a hypothetical Medicare reform proposal based on Paul Ryan's \"premium support\" proposal for the program.

This is especially true in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), a region that has experienced a \u201cnuclear renaissance\u201d since 2000. Many MENA states have sought to develop or acquire civilian nuclear technology.  Yet, risks emerge that such civilian nuclear technology could be diverted to building a nuclear weapon, the so-called \u201cdual-use\u201d problem. Even after a state has signed nonproliferation agreements and pledged to reserve nuclear technology for civilian use, such as energy or desalinization, it is conceivable that it could face national security threats that motivate the weaponization of this technology.  Examples from outside the MENA, notably North Korea, indicate that states that have signed nonproliferation treaties can opt out to build a nuclear bomb and pursue aggressive nuclear strategies.\n  \nDifferent explanations have sought to predict why states choose to weaponize civilian nuclear technology, previously reserved for peaceful purposes.  State-centric research emphasizes incentives created by threats in the international system. If one state converts peaceful nuclear technology into a weapon, then neighboring states undertake a similar strategy for deterrence.  The fact that all states fear the possible consequences of nuclear war does not discrouage proliferation but it does foster a \u201cnuclear balance\u201d of peace among states. Other studies look at domestic politics, and how individual leaders might earn political points by weaponizing nuclear technology. Egypt\u2019s Jamal \u2018Abdel Nasser and Pakistan\u2019s Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, for example, improved their domestic political positions by re-directing civilian nuclear technology to military programs.  \n\nLittle research, however, has examined the role of citizen attitudes in this process, and public opinion on decisions to weaponize technology in nuclear latent states.  The conditions under which citizens express support for the weaponization of nuclear technology previously reserved for peaceful, civilian purposes has been underexplored.  How might the identity of an enemy state posing a hostile threat affect citizen attitudes toward weaponization?  In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, does a hypothetical threat from Iran, Israel, or another Arab state have a larger effect in raising (or depressing) Arab public support for building and, ultimately, using a nuclear bomb?  Because Iran, Israel, and neighboring Arab states vary in their military strength, nuclear capacities, and cultural traits, it is likely that citizens of an Arab state receiving the threat\u2014in this study, Morocco\u2014will not perceive these threats equally.  Rather, threats issued from one of these states may be more (or less) likely to increase citizens\u2019 support for building and using a nuclear bomb.  To investigate this topic, this project proposes to use a population-based survey experiment to explore citizen attitudes toward the dual-use problem of nuclear technology. Specifically, the project will use funding from the University of Tennessee\u2019s Institute for Nuclear Security to conduct a 2000 person survey experiment in Morocco, a nuclear latent state in the MENA region that has an active civilian nuclear program since the 1980s.

Context \u2013 Pakistan Passport Office\nIn recent years, governments in developing countries have started using technologies to monitor service delivery, improve governance and deter petty corruption. In Pakistan, such efforts have been translated into various initiatives such as the Passport Office\u2019s SMS RAABTA. In an effort to 1) strengthen active engagement with the public and collect feedback on issues faced in service delivery, 2) improve performance monitoring and 3) enhance accountability, the passport authority set up a feedback mechanism using mobile phone text messaging. \n\nShortly after a visit to a Regional Passport Office (RPO \u2013 where h/she has shared basic information such as mobile number), the applicant receives a text message shortly asking 1) if he/she faced any problem during the visit and, 2) if he/she was asked to pay any bribe. Applicants\u2019 responses are thereafter recoded into 8 categories (\u201cAll OK\u201d, \u201cSuggestions\u201d, \u201cProcess Delays\u201d, \u201cStaff Attitude\u201d, \u201cCorruption\u201d, \u201cProcedural Difficulties\u201d, \u201cAgents\u201d, \u201cBank Delays\u201d). A follow up is made in cases where complaints about agents and corruption are received and, if relevant, further investigation can take place. The powerful deterrence created by the direct and easy communication between citizens and the government and the credible threat of punitive action is thought to improve the quality of government services and curb non-collusive corruption. \n\nThere are currently 95 RPO across Pakistan which serve between 14,000 and 20,000 applicants daily. So far, based on data from the pilot phase (August 2015), 87% of the feedback received was positive. However, the response rate was fairly low: only 16% of all texted applicants replied. The effectiveness of the SMS RAABTA in identifying service quality issues and cases of corruption is intimately tied to the response rate. Improving the response rate is crucial for the following reasons. Without a representative sample, the collected data might over-represent the satisfactory accounts and prompt erroneous conclusions. In these circumstances, the head of the RPO faces limited ability to properly address service quality and corruptions issues. Consequentially, citizen satisfaction with government performance and accountability is likely to remain low. \n\n2. Theoretical Background \nWhy is it that some citizens decide to contribute their time and resources to provide feedback and report on their recent interaction with bureaucrats while others simply ignore the invitation from the Passport Office? Some parallels with non-response in surveys are possible here. The decision to take part in a survey is influenced by a variety of factors (e.g. individual traits, socio-economic status, etc.) and it is generally considered that the design of the survey itself (i.e. its presentation, length, wording, aesthetics, etc.) can impact a great deal on that decision (Edwards et al., 2010). As a corollary to this, the way the issues considered by the survey are framed can have varying psychological and behavioural effects (Stalans, 2012; Tourangeau & Ye, 2009; Chong & Druckman, 2007; Tversky & Kahneman, 1986; Pi\u00f1on & Gambara, 2005). In other words, two invitations to participate to a survey requesting the same action but highlighting different ideas either about the benefits or downsides of participation can prove to act as different incentives and thus prompt different behaviours. The main objective of this research is to improve the passport citizen feedback model by experimentally assessing the effectiveness of different frames implemented in text messaging invitations to participate in SMS RAABTA. \n\nDrawing on the framing effect literature, we develop three variation of participant invitations (i.e. a negative frame, a positive-individualistic frame and positive-civic duty frame) that have been demonstrated to effectively increase survey participation. For instance, it has been suggested that sensitivity to negative consequences (Stalans, 2012, 78; Tversky & Kahneman, 1986; Tversky & Kahneman, 1981) is perhaps greater in some contexts than sensitivity to positive outcomes. When considered in the context of the SMS RAABTA, a frame highlighting the negative consequences of not participating (e.g., Due to the lack of citizen feedback, corruption and poor quality of service are still an issue at some passport offices) can thus prove to be an effective way to increase response. In contrast, it has been demonstrated in other contexts that highlighting current successes (e.g., Thousands have already responded to help improve the delivery and quality of service), can be an effective way of incentivizing individuals to participate. Although in a different context (i.e. charitable giving), several field experiments have revealed that highlighting what other have already contributed (i.e. in the case of charitable giving, seed money; in the case of the SMS RAABTA, time and feedback) had a significant and constant effect to boost participation (List, 2011; Rondeau & List, 2008; List & Lucking-Riley, 2002). Finally, a variation of the positive frame will be devised to justify the participation to the SMS RAABTA on civic duty grounds by stressing a sense of obligation (e.g., As a citizen of Pakistan it is your civic duty to denounce corruption and help improve service quality). Here the potential respondent is not solicited with regards to the expected outcome of his individual participation, but rather by claiming that as a citizen he has a clear responsibility to report cases of bureaucrat misbehaviour. Similar civic duty frames have been used in studies of electoral turnout (Blais & Achen, 2010) and it has been found to increase turnout by almost 10% (Green & Gerber, 2000). Based on existing research and pilot testing in Lahore last year, we expect the `positive-civic duty\u2019 frame to have the largest response rate, followed by the `negative\u2019 and `positive-individualistic\u2019 frame. Based on the pilot phase we estimate an increase in the response rate by about 10 percentage points.\n\nBeyond the practical aim of improving the response rate of the current feedback mechanism, this research is meant to contribute substantively to the framing literature in several ways. First, it will assess framing effects in a novel context (i.e. Pakistan\u2019s Passport Office), therefore contributing to an understanding of citizen feedback mechanisms in developing countries and to the particularities of framing effects in that context. Secondly, by rigorously assessing the effects of the various frames on response rates our study will contribute to the still largely unexplored relation between framing and participation. Finally, by systematically comparing the marginal effects of the various frames to one another, our study will allow us to demonstrate the ordered importance of the various frames and thus explore the differential receptivity of information presented in different ways. In sum, our project combines the practical aim of increasing SMS RAABTA\u2019s response rate with the academic aim of experimentally evaluating the relation of framing effects on participation and to explore the psychology of survey participation. \n", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": 4000.0, "extra": []}, "id": "20160426AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "NA", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "Based on the theoretical suggestions highlighted above, we can propose the following hypotheses for the main outcome of this study (i.e. response rate): \n\nH1: Compared to the baseline script, alternate versions of invitations (i.e. `negative\u2019, `positive-individualistic\u2019 or `positive-civic duty\u2019 frames) to participate in SMS RAABTA will increase response rate. \n\nWhen taking into consideration the specific nature of the frames, as described above, we can propose the following hypothesis, comparing the marginal effects of the various frames: \n\nH2: We expect the `positive-individualistic\u2019 frame to have the smallest effect on response rate, followed by `negative\u2019, and the `positive-civic duty\u2019 frame. \n\nLet us note here that this hypothesis stems mainly from the theoretical literature but that we have highlighted mixed empirical support for alternative hypotheses. \n\nSecondary outcomes are also relevant for our evaluation. For instance, when turning to the commented responses from citizens, we can assess the effect of the various scripts on the rate of complaints (as opposed to positive responses). More specifically, we can expect the following:\n\nH3: We expect the `positive-individualistic\u2019 frame to have the smallest effect on complaints rate, followed by the `negative\u2019, and the `positive-civic duty\u2019 frame.\n \nSimilarly, we can assess the effects of the various frames on reports of corruption.

The evidence generated by this project will enable us to either support or disconfirm existing theories relevant to framing effects but will also allow us to provide evidence-based suggestions with regards to which intervention would be suitable for full implementation in the SMS RAABTA to increase response rate. \n", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Improving Participation in Public Feedback Mechanisms: A Framing Experiment in Pakistan Passport Offices", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "NA", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "NA", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Patrick M Kuhn, Pierre-Oliver B\u00e9dard", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Citizen Feedback Model (CFM) in conjuncture with the Pakistani Office for Passports & Immigration", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "After having explored descriptive statistics to assess whether observables between the four groups are balanced, a simple linear regression analysis will be used to test the hypotheses and estimate the impact of the frames.

The claim is that politicians and other actors involved in the blame game will strive towards avoiding failures instead of achieving the best results.

The claimed causality between negativity bias prevailing both among politicians and citizens and blame avoidance is theoretically supported, but still needs further empirical testing. Furthermore the study of blame avoidance has traditionally been centered on the behavior of politicians, and it is only recently that researchers have started to examine the role of blame avoidance among government officials. \nIn order to shed more light on this issue I set out to test the correlation between negativity bias and blame avoidance strategies among future government officials by answering the following questions: \nHow are future government officials affected by negative framing of performance information about public policy initiatives? And are they more inclined to make use of blame avoidance strategies when exposed to negative framing than when exposed to positive framing?\nIn order to be able to detect signs of blame avoidance-behavior I will let respondents comment on their initial judgment of the effects of three initiatives.

Nyhan and Reifler (2010) found that corrections failed to reduce misperceptions and, in some extreme cases produced a \u201cbackfire effect\u201d in which corrections strengthened misperceptions. Fridkin et al. (2015) showed that fact-checks of negative television advertisements influenced people\u2019s assessments of the accuracy, usefulness, and tone of negative political advertisements. Finally, Nyhan and Reifler (2016) showed that there was no evidence that exposure to fact-checking affected people\u2019s attitudes toward the practice, trust in politicians, or feelings of political efficacy, but exposure to fact-checking did increase how much people knew about contemporary political controversies and debates. \n\nThe specific objective of this project is to examine the effects of summary fact-checking, an innovation in the field that is becoming more common. This format presents an overview of ratings of the accuracy of a politician\u2019s statements rather than an evaluation of a single statement. Our study will measure the effects of summary fact-checks on a politician\u2019s perceived accuracy and favorability. This project will also compare the effects of summary fact-checks to individual fact-checks that only verify a singular statement. We expect that summary fact-checking will be seen as more comprehensive and less selective than individual fact-checks and may therefore have a greater effect on public perceptions of politicians. \n\nOur experiment will therefore assess whether or not the effect of individual fact-checks differs from the effect of summary fact-checks on an individual\u2019s favorability toward a politician or the perceived accuracy of their statements. We will also take the political affiliation of both the participant and the politician into account, so we can determine whether the effects of individual and summary fact-checks vary by whether the target is a co-partisan or an opposition partisan. Finally, we will also consider whether these effects vary by political knowledge and analyze whether exposure to summary or individual fact-checks affects attitudes toward the practice more generally. The results of this experiment will allow us to understand the efficacy of different forms of fact-checking, which may help us better understand how news outlets\u2019 fact-checking practices influence public opinion.

Researchers have no role in selecting the participants after listing the project on Mechanical Turk.\n\nRandomization approach\n\nWe will use a between-subjects design in which respondents are randomly assigned to one of six conditions by the Qualtrics online survey platform (p=1/6 for each):\n\nSummary fact-check treatment conditions:\n-Fact-checking a Democrat (Harry Reid; asked about him first)\n-Fact-checking a Republican (Mitch McConnell; asked about him first)\n\nIndividual fact-check treatment conditions:\n-Fact-checking a Democrat (Harry Reid; asked about him first)\n-Fact-checking a Republican (Mitch McConnell; asked about him first)\n\nControl conditions (placebo image/text; no fact-check provided):\n-Asked about perceptions of a Democrat first (Harry Reid) \n-Asked about perceptions of a Republican first (Mitch McConnell)\n\nData collection and blinding\n\nData will be collected on the Qualtrics online survey platform. There may be some online discussion among Mechanical Turk workers about the details of our survey. This cannot be prevented and we hope that these participants preserve the integrity of the research.\n\nPrimary and secondary outcome measures\n\nOur primary outcome variables are perceptions of the favorability and accuracy of the fact-check target (McConnell or Reid) compared to participants in the control group who were asked first about the same person. Each outcome variable will be measured on a five-point scale:\n\nThe next few questions will be about Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY), the Majority Leader of the Senate. In general, how often do you think that he makes accurate statements?\n-All of the time (5)\n-Most of the time (4)\n-About half the time (3)\n-Occasionally (2)\n-Never  (1)\n\nDo you have a favorable or unfavorable view of Senator McConnell (R-KY)?\n-Very favorable (5)\n-Somewhat favorable (4)\n-Neither favorable nor unfavorable (3)\n-Somewhat unfavorable (2)\n-Very unfavorable (1)\n\nThe next few questions will be about Senator Harry Reid (D-NV), the former Majority Leader of the Senate. In general, how often do you think that he makes accurate statements?\n-All of the time (5)\n-Most of the time (4)\n-About half the time (3)\n-Occasionally (2)\n-Never  (1)\n\nDo you have a favorable or unfavorable view of Senator Reid (D-NV)?\n-Very favorable (5)\n-Somewhat favorable (4)\n-Neither favorable nor unfavorable (3)\n-Somewhat unfavorable (2)\n-Very unfavorable (1)\n\nOur secondary outcome variables measure opinions toward fact-checking using the following questions, which will be analyzed separately and also as a composite measure if they scale together using principal components factor analysis.\n\nIn general, how favorable or unfavorable is your overall opinion of the fact-checking movement in journalism?\n-Very favorable (6)\n-Somewhat favorable (5)\n-Slightly favorable (4)\n-Slightly unfavorable (3)\n-Somewhat unfavorable (2)\n-Very unfavorable (1)\n\nThinking about the amount of fact-checking that you see being performed today by journalists, do you think there should be more fact-checking, the current amount of fact-checking is about right, or there should be less fact-checking?\n-There should be more fact-checking. (3)\n-The current amount of fact-checking is about right. (2)\n-There should be less fact-checking.

(1)\n-Fact-checkers tend to favor one side. (0)\n\nStatistical analyses\n\nFor each of our analyses, we will use OLS with robust standard errors and estimate ordered probit models with robust standard errors as a robustness check. Unless otherwise noted, all experimental treatment effects will be estimated as intent to treat effects. Leaners will be treated as partisans in our statistical analyses. Perceptions of politicians will only be assessed for the first politician for which outcome measures were collected to avoid contrast effects. \n\nParticipants\u2019 political knowledge will be assessed with a standard five-question battery that test participant knowledge of U.S. electoral rules and awareness of current political figures. Partisanship is measured on a standard seven-point scale administered via branching questions. \n\nOur primary model will be pooled regressions for individuals who saw either candidate, but we will also estimate regressions interacting target politician with fact-checking type (the main explanatory variable). If we cannot reject the null of no difference in effects by target, we will present the pooled model and also present separate results for Reid and McConnell either in the main text or an appendix. If the effects of key explanatory variables differ depending on the fact-checking target, we will present separate models for Reid and McConnell in the main text for expositional clarity and present interactive models in an appendix. We will estimate marginal effects as appropriate when interaction terms are included in our models. (We will also estimate our treatment effect models with standard demographic controls and report these results if the treatment effect estimate is substantively different from the model only including partisan affiliation.)\n\nTo test H1, we will estimate the model y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC for the accuracy and favorability outcome measures. To test H2, we will then evaluate b1-b2 directly for each outcome measure. \n\nTo test H3, we will estimate the model y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC+b3*copartisan+b4*opposition+b5*summaryFCXcopartisan+b6*summaryFCXopposition+b7*individualFCXcopartisan+b8*individualFCXopposition and then estimate b5-b6 and b7-b8. \n\n[Per above, we will estimate all pairwise comparisons in treatment effects between partisan groups. However, we expect to encounter power problems given the relatively small number of pure independents and may thus focus on the comparison between the co-partisan and opposition partisan groups.]\n\nTo test RQ1, we will first estimate the model y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC+b3*knowledge+ b4*summaryFCXknowledge+b5*individualFCXknowledge and then estimate y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC+b3*copartisan+b4*opposition+b5*summaryFCXcopartisan+b6*summaryFCXopposition+b7*individualFCXcopartisan+b8*individualFCXopposition +b9*knowledge+b10*summaryFCXknowledge+b11*individualFCXknowledge+b12*copartisanXknowledge+b13*oppositionXknowledge+b14*summaryFCXknowledgeXopposition+b15*individualFCXknowledgeXopposition. In each model, we will estimate whether the effects of the fact-checks vary by political knowledge versus the control group and each other (and, in the latter case, by partisanship as well). We will test whether the effect of knowledge is linear per Hainmueller et al. and follow their recommendations if not. We may also present a simple median split on knowledge in the main text and report the continuous interaction model in the appendix for expositional clarity. We will follow the same procedures for education, grouping all the some college/associate groups together in the continuous measure and treating college/non-college as the relevant binary measure. \n\nTo test RQ2, we will estimate the model y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC for individual fact-check opinion measures and the composite fact-check opinion measure (if they scale together) and then estimate b1-b2.", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": 43044.0, "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "United States", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Registration prior to realization of outcomes", "extra": []}, "timestamp": "05/07/2016 - 23:42"}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": 42503.0, "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "Theoretical Motivation and Contribution:\n\nDeveloping democracies around the world have rapidly expanded voting rights to citizens living outside of the country \u2013 from 17 countries in 1980 to over 120 today.

One potential source of replacement is to increase female labor force participation.  But, women are increasingly facing caregiving responsibilities for their children as well as their aging parents (and potentially, their in-laws).  This increased caregiving burden has resulted in women choosing to forgo a career to focus on caregiving or to forgo having children to focus on career, both of which make replacing a retiring workforce more difficult.  \n\nIt has been argued that immigration of caregivers may be a panacea to this problem, freeing native women from the burdens of caregiving.  Yet, not all women are willing to entrust the care of their children or their elderly relatives to immigrants.  We argue that due to concerns about ability of an immigrant caregiver to provide for a child's intellectual development, native women (and parents in general) will be less supportive of immigration of childcare workers than of elder-care workers and that this will hold more strongly in societies where children are more rigidly track in school and the labor market is more highly regulated.

Despite a proclaimed commitment to democracy and human rights, evident both in the American political discourse and in U.S. foreign policy statements, reactions to these mobilizations around the world have varied. In this paper, we explore how features of pro- democratic movements in foreign countries shape American preferences for U.S. action towards the regime challenged by the protesters.

The dependent variables, respectively, will be level of intensity for policy preferences and level of intensity for political behavior. We measure the former by the degree of support for U.S. imposing economic sanctions on the country challenged by the protesters (7-point scale). We measure the latter by recording the costliest action the respondents are willing to engage in out of 7 choices: none of the above, sign a petition, donate money, call or write a letter to a Congressional representative, participate in a protest outside of the US Congress building, organize a protest outside of the US Congress building, take up a full-time leadership role in a national campaign.\nFinally, since the structure of these dependent variables might not allow enough space for treatment effects to emerge, we ask a question that utilizes a continuous dependent variable. In particular, we ask respondents to say how much money they\u2019d be willing to donate in support of the protesters. We will run an OLS regression of the donation amount on treatment.\nIndependent variables for each regression will include a dummy variable reflecting the main treatment -- violent vs. non-violent police response. To increase the precision of our results, the we will include the following demographic and political engagement covariates in the regression: age, gender, party ID, education, household income, voted in the last election, ethnicity, news consumption, past protest participation, and levels of interventionism and authoritarianism\nAs a robustness check, we will also run differences-in-means tests for this hypothesis.\n\nH2: To test this hypothesis, we will first split our sample into three sub-groups, based on treatment assignment i.e. respondents who watched a video with European/Asian/Arab protesters. \nWithin each subgroup, we will run an OLS regression of our 3 DVs on a dummy indicating a match between respondent and protester ethnicity. We also include a dummy variable for violent vs. non-violent police response and the set of political engagement/demographic variables above, excluding ethnicity. For example, to analyze the policy DV for respondents assigned to European protesters, the equation would look the following way:\nSupport for economic sanctions ~ white/non-white + violence + political/demographic controls\nSimilarly, for respondents assigned to Asian protesters:\nSupport for economic sanctions ~ Asian/non-Asian + violence + political/demographic controls\nGiven that there are three DVs and three ethnicities, this totals to 9 OLS regressions. Note: it is possible that we will only be able to run 6 of these equations given the low representation of Arabs in American society and, in particular, in the MTurk workforce.\nAs a robustness check, we will also run differences-in-means tests for this hypothesis.\n\nH2A will be analyzed in the same way as H2 but including social dominance orientation (SDO) score as an independent variable, as well as an interaction between the identity match dummy and SDO score.\n\nFor H2B, we will test our three DVs using interaction terms between treatment (protester ethnicity) and thermometer score for that part of the world. E.g. sanctions ~ Asia + Asia*warmth(Asia) + warmth(Asia). This will lead to a total of nine different OLS regressions.\n\nH3: H3 will be tested in a similar way to H2. Six linear regressions will be run, but we will combine ethnicity categories into white and non-white categories. \nIn addition, we will run three blame regressions measuring level of blame imputed to protesters, police, and host government.

The results of this question will be analyzed in one of two ways depending on the amount of text data generated by respondents. Following standard practices (see for instance, Tomz, 2007), we encourage respondents to generate a sufficient amount of text data by asking them to explain their answers in a few sentences.) Ideally we will conduct our analysis using a Structural Topic Model (For an overview of the application of Structural Topic Models to political science see Lucas et al. (n.d.) and Roberts et al. (2014).) In the context of a survey experiment, the STM can be used to estimate the effect of a treatment embedded within the survey on text written by survey subjects.  If respondents do not generate a sufficient amount of text to make informative and meaningful inferences then we will be unable to use a Structural Topic Model and will instead rely upon human coders. Following standard procedures, we will define the dimensions on which open-ended data will be coded by reading a small sample of the open-ended responses. The human coders will then classify the open-ended responses into the different categories for each of the treatment categories. The use of either a Structural Topic Model or human coders will allow us to explore the extent to which the theoretical logic driving the hypotheses presented is prevalent across each of our different treatment categories.\n\nResults will be reported for each of the tests at standard statistical significance levels (0.01, 0.05, 0.1).

We also identify a set of plausible counter-strategies that can reduce the success of hybrid propaganda.  \n\nMessages used in the hybrid wars of information have three theoretically interesting aspects.

Second, they may contain additional information that supports a particular judgment of an event, either by providing an interpretation of the facts or by distorting those.

Two features of political belief systems are particularly important: pre-existing beliefs concerning and affect toward the (hidden) source of the message, and the level of political sophistication of the audience. We test the hypothesis that pre-existing beliefs affect the effect of propaganda using both cross-national variation in culture (whether it is pro-Russian or not), and individual level variation in pre-existing perceptions of the foreign country. Similarly, to test the hypothesis that political sophisticates are less affected by propaganda, we use both cross-national variation in the quality of media markets, and individual-level variation in the level of political sophistication. \n\nThe content of the message should also affect the success of the propaganda. We hypothesize that the content, described as the \u201caxis of attack\u201d the message relies on, will be effective to the extent that it matches the \u201cvulnerability\u201d of the audience. Thus, we should expect people concerned with peace to be more affected by messages using the belligerence angle. We can test this hypothesis by measuring vulnerabilities in the non-experimental part of the survey, and use experimental frames to manipulate the \u201caxis of attack\u201d.  \n\nAdditionally, want to explore which strategies are more effective for discrediting this type of propaganda.

Then, respondents will randomly learn that the bill passed or failed with bipartisan support or without bipartisan support (a 2x2 treatment design). To ease respondent comprehension, the bill\u2019s fate will be explained qualitatively, without the use of numbers.

We can imagine two reasons why they might. One explanation is that elected officials respond more favorably to members of their in-group (Butler and Crabtree, 2015). Using both observational methods and experimental studies, scholars have repeatedly found that office holders respond more often and provide better advice to individuals like them (Grose, 2014; Butler, 2014). These findings suggest that since elected officials are citizens and mostly native-born, they should prefer to help native-born constituents over immigrants. A second explanation is rooted in the importance that elected officials place on retaining office. In theory, office-seeking politicians should focus their work on maximizing voter support. To the degree that this is true, we should expect office holders to favor the native born, whose citizenship is conferred automatically, than immigrants, only a fraction of whom attain citizenship.\n\nHow are we then to evaluate the competing explanations of in-group bias vs. office seeking? This line of inquiry faces a fundamental obstacle, because immigrants are both less likely to vote, and more likely to belong to an out-group relative to their elected representative.

I expect to find evidence that demonstrates that when the news media interprets distant events as holding lessons for their local audience, people are more likely to support costly disaster risk reduction policy, as they perceive themselves as at risk from similar disasters. However, when the news coverage establishes differences between the affected community and the local audience, people are less likely to support these policies, as their perception of their risk does not change.

In turn, this study examines how to effectively strengthen these vulnerable populations\u2019 ability to exercise the basic rights to which they are entitled. To do so, we plan to examine how these groups access dental care in particular, vary the types of barriers they face, and then reflect on how best to remove these obstacles. We chose to focus on dental care based on focus groups and interviews we fielded earlier on, which suggested that the need for dental care was particularly high among poor communities in Greece. This will be accomplished via a nationwide school survey experiment conducted in Greece throughout the month of June 2016. \n\n\nThere are a number of existing experimental evaluations of barriers to legal rights and public services focused on vulnerable populations\u2019 experiences. However, this type of research primarily focuses on understanding the experiences of a single minority group, whereas ours examines different types of barriers faced by a variety of low-income groups. This allows us to make a number of important baseline comparisons. Furthermore, most examinations of barrier reduction fail to measure actual behavior change, and therefore raise concerns about external validity (Wallace 2014; Chilton 2016). We vary multiple types of barriers (from self-addressed, stamped mailers to phone hotlines to more difficult mailers), so that we can compare the relative effectiveness of each. Our theoretical contribution is thereby twofold: 1) we move the study of low-income communities\u2019 barriers from the traditional single-group focus to a comparative examination, and 2) we operationalize the difficulty of barriers as a function of willingness to take action (e.g., willingness to call a hotline to find out more information about free dental programs).\n\nMore specifically, this study contributes to an understanding of the conditions under which different vulnerable groups access their health rights. We measure behavioral change, examining whether (a) self-addressed, stamped mailers; (b) more \u201cdifficult\u201d mailers that require purchasing a stamp; (c) phone hotlines, or (d) an email is most effective in mobilizing groups to access free dental programs. In sum, the most innovative element of this research project is that we can actually operationalize the gradient of difficulty imposed by each of these barriers (via discrepancies in respondents\u2019 willingness to reach out for more information) and thereby measure behavioral changes. Note that we do not track behavioral change across time in individuals, but use random assignment into our experimental conditions to draw inference about behavioral impacts.\n\n\nOur theoretical contribution is simple; although more and more scholars are experimenting with easing access to public services and barrier reduction techniques, this body of work is still largely underdeveloped. Grossman and Michelitch (2015) just recently collected data from Uganda on the effectiveness of text messaging software in connecting vulnerable groups to local politicians. However, as Ensor and Cooper (2006) find, these \u201cdemand-side barriers\u201d have been rarely studied, and even more rarely has there been experimental manipulation of barrier-reducing technologies. Over the past decade, some studies have experimented with demand side financing (DSF) mechanisms to transfer purchasing power to vulnerable populations (Schmidt et al. 2010). However, demand-side financial interventions are still much more prominent in the literature than non-financial ones, and even when studies feature non-financial interventions, they are mostly informational interventions (Jacobs et al. 2012). As such, it has been difficult to understand the relative effectiveness of non-monetary interventions in comparison to one another\u2014especially interventions that, like our study, mimic various gradations of bureaucratic barriers. Our objective with this experiment is to move towards filling this gap.", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": 10000.0, "extra": []}, "id": "20160601AB", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "H1: Different \u201cdegrees\u201d of bureaucratic inconveniences can significantly affect vulnerable groups\u2019 willingness to seek out more information on their health rights. \n\nAs such, we expect more mobilization via the self-addressed (\u201ceasy\u201d) post-card variant versus the non-self-addressed (\u201cdifficult\u201d) variant. We are less certain about the discrepancies between email and phone hotlines, but generally assume that phone hotlines are the most convenient resource (i.e., weakest barrier) for ethnic Greeks, Roma, and Albanian populations who speak Greek well, whereas this may not be quite as \u201ceasy\u201d of a barrier for recent arrivals. With the email variant, the issue may be one of Internet access, and as such, the self-addressed post-card may produce a relatively easier access point to vulnerable, low-income groups. \n\nIn all likelihood, we will be able to conduct very limited subgroup analyses. From the names of respondents, we can infer ethnicity, and from their zip codes, we can approximate income. In a follow up question for phone respondents, we will also be able to ask: \u201cHave you lived in Greece for more or less than 5 years?\u201d to obtain an approximate measure on recent arrivals.  As such, we offer some hypotheses about which subgroups are likely to be especially impacted by our experiments.\n\nEthnicity: Populations in low-income communities face significant barriers to the exercise of fundamental rights. These include lack of information about legal rights, bureaucratic hurdles (e.g. long queues, extensive paperwork), perceived and actual social stigma, and linguistic barriers. We expect these barriers to intersect in different ways for different groups. As such, we expect differential responses between Albanian, Syrian, Afghani/Pakistani, Roma, and ethnic Greek groups. For example, preliminary pilot interviews suggest that members of the Roma community (a stigmatized Greek minority) are well informed about entitlements, but face racism in obtaining benefits from the Greek state. In contrast, Greek nationals who have only recently become unemployed are sometimes poorly informed about social benefits, and are hesitant to discuss their plight in front of neighbors. Recently arrived migrants and refugees (Syrian, Afghani, Pakistani) often face the heaviest obstacles: in addition to language and race-based barriers, the Greek state requires extensive documentation before individuals can access any benefit. This can be especially onerous for recent arrivals. However, we do expect Syrians to be, generally, better informed than their Afghani and Pakistani counterparts, because there have been substantial resources and funding set aside toward addressing the crisis situation of Syrian refugees. The plight of Syrian refugees has also been a prominent issue in the media over the last year.  \n\nAs such, we expect that differential experiences with different modes of communication (email, phone, mail) are a function of culture, past experiences with bureaucracy, as well as a function of Greek language skills. We expect that Syrian refugees as well as recent Afghani and Pakistani migrants may feel more hesitant to reach out via phone, but more open to using email or traditional mail to connect and reach out for more information. It is difficult to know beforehand exactly which households have regular internet access, and as such, we cannot predict how well the phone hotline versus the email variant will perform as access points to dental program information.\n\n\nCohorts: As mentioned, we will, at most, obtain a binary measure of cohort (new arrival versus more established migrants/populations). Similar to our hypothesis for different ethnic groups, we expect that differential experiences with different modes of communication (email, phone, mail) are also a function of cohort effects, as well as a function of Greek language skills. As such, new arrivals may feel more hesitant to reach out via phone, but more open to using email or traditional mail to connect and reach out for more information. \n\n\nLocation: When we obtain zip code information, we will be able to distinguish households who (a) live in rural vs. urban areas; (b) live in relatively more impoverished vs. relatively less impoverished areas (acknowledging gradations of poverty within low-income communities); and (c) live in ethnically heterogeneous vs. homogenous communities. We expect more impoverished groups to be discouraged by the \u201chard\u201d postcard variant due to the price of stamps, and we expect internet access to be a more difficult barrier in more impoverished areas as well, in turn decreasing the effectiveness of the email variant. We expect urban areas to be more motivated to either call the phone hotline or send an email, but rural areas to be more accustomed to continuing outreach via more traditional mail methods. We also expect different effects in Roma communities\u2014which are geographically segregated, homogenous, and should be identifiable by zip code and other characteristics. Specifically, we expect each barrier to prove more difficult to overcome in Roma communities due to heavy stigmatization around their uptake of social benefits.\n\n\n", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Access to Health Rights in Low Income Communities: Barriers and Remedies for Refugees, Migrants and Natives", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": 42516.0, "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "2016-04-8621", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Katerina Linos, Laura Jakli, Melissa Anne Carlson", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Prolepsis", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "As a certified NGO that works closely with many public schools across Greece, Prolepsis is allowed to conduct surveys to measure school children\u2019s nutritional and health attributes and assess future needs.

This is not a serious limitation to our study, since we are seeking aggregate changes in response rate by subgroups, and as such, no individually identifying data would be necessary for our analyses.\n", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": 43040.0, "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "Greece", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Registration prior to assignment of treatment", "extra": []}, "timestamp": "06/01/2016 - 17:32"}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": 42523.0, "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "This experimental survey analysis which examines the nature of social, economic, and political barriers faced by refugees, migrants, and low-income natives in Greece. More specifically, this study examines how to effectively strengthen these vulnerable populations\u2019 ability to access free vaccination programs\u2014via different informational interventions. To do so, we plan to examine how these groups access basic rights and services, what barriers they face, and in turn experimentally vary informational interventions to examine how to best to remove these obstacles. This will be accomplished via a nationwide school survey experiment conducted in Greece throughout the month of June 2016. \n\nThis study offers an experimental examination of informational interventions and their effectiveness in reducing vulnerable groups\u2019 barriers to accessing vaccination programs. We have selected our focus as low-income communities because our findings can help understand how these barriers to health play out in particularly vulnerable areas.\n\nMore specifically, this study contributes to an understanding of the conditions under which informational interventions are effective for different vulnerable groups. We measure behavioral change, examining how standard messaging about vaccination (i.e. messaging concerning the health benefits of vaccines) compares to two other types of messaging, messaging about legal rights and legal obligations. More specifically, we examine whether (a) messaging about vaccines\u2019 impact on disease prevention (b) messaging about legal entitlements to vaccinations or (c) messaging about legal requirements for vaccination is more or less effective in mobilizing individuals to access vaccination programs. We suspect that members of different vulnerable communities may respond differently to different messages.\n\nIn sum, the most innovative element of this research project is that we can actually operationalize the effectiveness of informational interventions (via discrepancies in respondents\u2019 willingness to reach out for more information) and thereby measure behavioral changes. Note that we do not track behavioral change across time in individuals, but use random assignment into our experimental conditions to draw inference about behavioral impacts.\n\nThe simplest building block for our research stems from the literature on information primes \u2013most prominently associated with the work of Iyengar and Kinder (1982). Priming concerns the notion that ideas that have been recently encountered or frequently activated are more likely to come to mind and this will be used in interpreting social events. In our case, we assume that priming respondents with information about the importance of vaccination should raise the saliency of this health concern, and thus \u201ctreated\u201d participants should have a higher propensity to mobilize around the issue of vaccination.\n\nWhile a multitude of scholars have focused on what types of ideas have the greatest \u201cpriming\u201d power, finding again and again that priming an issue as a norm (i.e., \u201csocial pressure\u201d) is an effective way to actually influence individuals\u2019 behaviors (Cialdini et al. 1990; Gerber, Green and Larimer 2008), we know much less about the power of legal rights and obligations frames.\n\nBased on Schwartz and Orleans (1967) and later, a replication by McGraw and Scholz (1991), it appears that emphasizing legal obligations has a greater positive impact on tax compliance than did emphasizing self-interest (in our case, this parallels the simple health message). These studies suggest that the legal obligations framework can be a powerful tool in promoting certain behaviors. However, in general, there is a dearth of literature on the discrepancy between invoking legal rights versus legal obligations. Our study serves to fill this gap.\n\nWith this experiment, we also build on a strand of research in the human rights tradition that suggests that the language of fundamental rights can move public opinion. For example, support for torture declines (Wallace 2014), while support for health and labor rights (Linos 2013), as well as women\u2019s rights (Chilton 2016) increases when the language of fundamental rights is made salient to respondents. This strand of research has been criticized for lacking external validity; in particular, scholars question whether a response to a survey item would translate into any type of behavioral change. In our study, we plan to build on prior work, by asking respondents to take concrete follow-up action (i.e., making a phone-call).\n\nFurthermore, prior priming studies often focus on the creation of public goods, and there is less work on whether peer pressure might facilitate the realization of individual legal rights\u2014such as to vaccination. What we do know based on the aforementioned body of literature is that, generally, we can reasonably expect a 3 to 3.5 percentage point increase (i.e., mobilization) in the treatment group based on these classic informational interventions (Pande 2011). However, it is possible that the effect deviates when we use informational interventions not to create public goods, but instead to facilitate the realization of a health right.\n", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": 10000.0, "extra": []}, "id": "20160601AC", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "We will be able to determine respondents\u2019 nationality, how many kids they have, and how long they have lived in Greece, and also obtain zip code information. Prolepsis\u2019s phone operator will also observe whether information is sought in Greek or English, and will assess how easily they can communicate in one of these languages. We will also have access to information on comparative survey response rates among Greeks and non-Greeks. This population will be used to test our main hypothesis with regard to the impact of varying informational interventions on vaccination. This hypothesis is enumerated below.\n\n\nH1:  Relatively minor legal rights and obligations framing interventions can significantly reduce barriers to accessing vaccination programs in comparison to the standard messaging frame about health benefits.\n\n\nIn sum, we plan to investigate whether (a) providing people with information about legal entitlements; or (b) providing people with information about legal obligations, can significantly affect low-income communities\u2019 willingness to access vaccination programs, as compared to (c) standard messaging about health benefits.\n\nOnce again, the literature our research references concerns information provision (Iyengar and Kinder 1982; Gerber, Green and Larimer 2008; Cialdini et al. 1990). We assume that informing and/or priming respondents with regard to their legal rights and/or legal obligations should raise the salience of concern for vaccination, and thus households in these particular treatment groups should have a higher propensity to seek out more information on free vaccination programs versus the standard health messaging treatment. We are uncertain whether the legal rights or legal obligations frame will produce the most significant effect. Our theoretical prior is thus agnostic on this point, due to the dearth of literature on this specific distinction.\n\nIn all likelihood, we will be able to conduct limited subgroup analyses. As such, we offer some hypotheses about which subgroups are likely to be especially impacted by our experiment.\n\nEthnicity/Length of Residence in Greece: Populations in low-income communities face significant barriers to the exercise of fundamental rights. These include lack of information about vaccination programs, bureaucratic hurdles (e.g. long queues, extensive paperwork), perceived and actual social stigma, and linguistic barriers. We expect these barriers to intersect in different ways for different groups. As such, we expect differential responses between more recent arrivals in the past decade (such as Syrian, Afghani, and Pakistani migrants) and more established groups (such as the Roma, Albanians, and ethnic Greeks). \n\nFor example, ethnic Greeks and other long-term residents already have access to vaccines, so they might not feel the need to call in to obtain more information. At the same time, the ease of accessing additional information varies in the opposite direction; it is much easier for a Greek or long term resident to call in. We remain agnostic in our overall prediction as to whether Greeks/long term residents will call in at higher levels, because these two mechanisms work in opposite directions.\n\n\nMeanwhile, recently arrived migrants and refugees (Syrian, Afghani, Pakistani) often face heavy obstacles: in addition to language and race-based barriers, the Greek state requires extensive documentation before individuals can access any benefit. We expect that informational interventions may help overcome these recent arrivals\u2019 barriers, but we are uncertain how effective an informational intervention alone will be for these groups. Additionally, we expect that differential experiences with different modes of communication (email, phone, mail) are a function of Greek language skills. As such, Syrian refugees as well as recent Afghani and Pakistani migrants may feel more hesitant to reach out via phone, but more open to using email or traditional mail to connect and reach out for more information. We examine these variations in a related study (which will not be enumerated, as it is not the focus of this pre-analysis plan). In addition, we expect that the language of rights and obligations may resonate differently among more established and integrated populations, and as compared to recent arrivals.\n\n\nLocation/Network Density: When we obtain zip code information, we will be able to distinguish households who (a) live in rural vs. urban areas; (b) live in relatively more impoverished vs. relatively less impoverished areas (acknowledging gradations of poverty within low-income communities); and (c) live in ethnically heterogeneous vs. homogenous communities. We expect that respondents in less impoverished and more urban areas would change their opinions more in response to the invocation of legal rights and obligations language, as they are probably more familiar with these types of frames and have had greater prior exposure to this type of material. Additionally, since network density is a function of population density, we expect urban respondents to feel more at ease in accessing additional information. This can also at least partially be a function of how quickly recent arrivals can be integrated into Greek culture and acquire Greek language skills; we expect recent arrivals in urban areas with denser networks to be more comfortable reaching out for more information than recent arrivals residing in rural communities. We also expect that social ties are stronger in homogenous communities, which helps facilitate the same process as network density. We also expect different effects in Roma communities\u2014which are geographically segregated and should be identifiable by zip code and other characteristics. \n", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Access to Vaccines in Low Income Communities: Barriers and Remedies for Refugees, Migrants and Natives", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": 42516.0, "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "2016-04-8621", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Katerina Linos, Laura Jakli, Melissa Anne Carlson", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Prolepsis", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "As a certified NGO that works closely with many public schools across Greece, Prolepsis is allowed to conduct surveys to measure school children\u2019s nutritional and health characteristics and assess future needs.

They will be sending out the annual survey in June of 2016, and will be collected throughout the month. Participants in our survey are thus identified through these cooperating public schools. The sample population for our study will be approximately 10,000 households, but we expect very low response rates to our treatments. All these surveys are anonymous, and have a 4 digit identifying number of the subject's choice. This 4 digit number will not be linked to individual identifiers.\n\nThe evaluation sample consists of 10,000 households who will receive a school survey, with approximately 3,333 selected into receiving information about legal rights, and another 3,333 with information about legal requirements, on the hypothesis that each of these treatments could shift behavior, but that the legal requirements will have a stronger effect than the legal rights. There will also be a third treatment group (n=3,333) as a baseline measure, offering the standard health rationale for vaccination.\n\nIn past years, approximately 50% of households receiving the Prolepsis survey completed it, so we should have 5,000 household respondents in total. However, we expect most of these not to reach out for more information on vaccination; we expect no more than 5% of people initially contacted to call in ask for additional information. So we are expecting about 500 phone calls, distributed unevenly among the three treatment conditions. Our dependent variable is binary: subjects are coded as \u201c1\u201d if they choose to reach out for more information on vaccination programs, and \u201c0\u201d if they choose not to inquire via the phone hotline. This design provides a simple comparison across treatment groups.\n\nWe expect both the legal obligation and legal rights frames to have a significant effect, and the presence of the standard health frame to have little to no effect. Based on Prolepsis\u2019s past annual questionnaires and their experience with different mediums of communication, we estimate a 5% phone contact rate.\n\nIf it is the case that the legal obligation and legal rights frames have a similar effect, we plan to pool our observations, so that we have more respondents in this condition and have more power to our analyses.\n\nOur power calculations were made using the website http://clincalc.com/Stats/SampleSize.aspx, and are based on an alpha of 0.05, and a power value of 95%.

As such, it contributes to the budding literature on refugee integration efforts and their political effects, as well as to the conversation on how refugees perceive and build trust with their host governments. This study will be accomplished via a nationwide school survey experiment conducted in Greece throughout the month of June 2016. \n\nThere are a number of existing experimental evaluations of public services focused on vulnerable populations\u2019 experiences and attribution of these services. Irene Bloemraad\u2019s book Becoming a Citizen (2006) examines how settlement assistance helps facilitate immigrants\u2019 integration into the host country. But does public goods provision lead to misattribution of the source, or rather, does it lead vulnerable groups to build trust discriminately, with the service-providing institutions, organizations, or parties? Elizabeth Linos\u2019s (2013) work in Honduras indicates that even when a conditional cash transfer program was administered nationally, the program increased an incumbent mayor\u2019s chance at re-election by a whopping 39%, without significantly influencing voting behavior in presidential elections. It seems that misattribution can be a serious concern, especially in low-information settings. As such, our objective with this experiment is to examine attribution and misattribution of a food program to different levels of Greek government.\n\nMore specifically, our experimental manipulation will focus on the extent to which satisfaction with Greek NGO\u2019s (Prolepsis\u2019s) school food program makes certain groups more satisfied with all levels of governance and public services (i.e., if they attribute their satisfaction with one program indiscriminately) or, if there is greater satisfaction at more local levels such that the satisfaction does not \u201ctrickle up.\u201d We plan to make information about the origins of the funding salient for some (but not all) of these government-funded meals. To do so, in the \u201ctreatment\u201d group, we remind people that the regional Greek government is contributing funds for the school lunch program. We will then ask questions about satisfaction with the program itself, with the national government, and the regional government. We anticipate that many low-income respondents will miss distinctions between different levels of government, and positive feelings towards the food program will extend to the regional government funding the program and to the central government (currently run by the opposite political party) (see Dekker et al. 2015, 634).\n\n", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": 10000.0, "extra": []}, "id": "20160601AD", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "H1: Support for the regional government will increase among respondents who have been reminded that the regional government is contributing to the free lunch program.\n\nH2: Support for the national government will not change among respondents who have been reminded that the regional government is contributing to the free lunch program.\n\nH3: Support for the food program will not change among respondents who have been reminded that regional government is contributing to the free lunch program.\n\nWe seek to assess these groups\u2019 level of satisfaction with public service programs and Prolepsis\u2019s school food program in particular. We specifically examine distinctions in satisfaction based on information about the provider of this food program. We expect an increase in support (i.e., satisfaction) for the regional government when the credit attribution is made salient, while satisfaction with the national government/the food program itself should be indistinguishable between treatment and control.\n\nBased on prior research, we expect to find significant subgroup effects related to overall satisfaction levels with public policy. We expect different subgroups will respond very differently to the experimental manipulation just proposed. More specifically, it will be interesting to see the differential responses of Albanian, Syrian Afghani/Pakistani, and Roma groups. We will also examine cohort effects as well as location-based and education-based variations. \n\nCohorts/Ethnicities: As Maxwell (2010) finds, there is significant variation in political attitudes across migrant generations in Europe. While \u201cfirst-generation migrants have the most positive attitudes\u2026native-origin and second-generation migrant-origin individuals have similar political trust and satisfaction scores\u201d (26). Maxwell argues that subjective integration factors related to the stages of migration explain this outcome. Specifically, \u201cfirst- generation migrants, who have gone through the disruptive process of changing countries, will have lower expectations and be more likely to have positive evaluations of the host society\u201d (26). In contrast, \u201cnative-origin and second-generation migrant origin individuals have been raised in the same society and are likely to share perspectives toward that society\u2019s political institutions\u201d(26). Since each of these ethnic groups is associated with different cohorts of immigration, we expect differential results. In short, we hypothesize that (a) baseline levels of satisfaction with the program, and especially with different levels of Greek government will differ depending on whether respondents are native Greeks, long-time residents, or recent arrivals and (b) native Greeks and long-term residents will be better able to attribute credit correctly than than recent arrivals. That is, we should see less \u201ctrickling up\u201d among native Greeks (and possibly long-term residents) than among recent arrivals.\n\n\nLocation: When we obtain zip code information, we will be able to distinguish households who (a) live in rural vs. urban areas; (b) live in relatively more impoverished vs. relatively less impoverished areas (acknowledging gradations of poverty within low-income communities); and (c) live in ethnically heterogeneous vs. homogenous communities. We expect that respondents in more urban areas tend to misattribute satisfaction with the food program to the national government more often than do rural households, who may be more closely tied to their respective regional government. We also expect more impoverished households to be more likely to be indiscriminate in their attribution of public goods programs. We also expect different effects in Roma communities\u2014which are geographically segregated, homogenous, and should be identifiable by zip code and other characteristics. (We also expect baseline satisfaction levels with the national and regional governments to differ by location, in accordance with the geographic distribution of results in the most recent elections, in which the national government was disproportionately successful in large cities). \n\nEducation: Based on Prolepsis\u2019s portion of the survey, we will be able to distinguish between the education levels of respondents. As such, we expect more highly educated respondents to be better able to distinguish between the regional/national government, and in turn, expect less educated respondents to be more indiscriminate in their attribution of satisfaction. \n\nPoverty/Hunger: We expect that levels of satisfaction with a food lunch program (and with governments given credit for this program) may depend on respondents\u2019 income and in particular on their need for food supplementation.\n\nEmployment/Integration: We expect that respondents who are better integrated in Greek society, as proxied by the length of time they have resided in Greece, their ability to secure employment, and other measures, will be both more satisfied with government efforts, and better able to distinguish between regional and national government efforts.\n", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Public Services in Low Income Communities: Understanding Migrant and Minority Integration Efforts and the Credit Attribution of Public Goods Provision", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": 42516.0, "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "2016-04-8621", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Katerina Linos, Laura Jakli, Melissa Anne Carlson", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Prolepsis", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "As a certified NGO that works closely with many public schools across Greece, Prolepsis is allowed to conduct surveys to measure school children\u2019s nutritional and health attributes and assess future needs.

We do this by reminding half of households that the regional Greek government is contributing funds for the school lunch program. We will then ask questions about satisfaction with the food program itself, with the regional government, as well as with the national government. \n\nWith an expected response rate of 50%, we should have 5,000 household respondents in total, with 2,500 households each in treatment and control. After households are either reminded of the regional government\u2019s support for the food program or not, we measure satisfaction with the program, with the national government, and with the regional government. This design provides a simple comparison across treatment and control groups.\n\nIn the past, Prolepsis\u2019s annual questionnaires had yielded a 50% response rate, so we expect something similar this time, since we are just adding an extra page of questions to the standard survey.

However, debate has emerged on the extent to which Bayesian analysis can and should be formalized in qualitative research.  This task entails assigning numerical values to all probabilities of interest in Bayes\u2019 theorem (i.e., priors on hypotheses and likelihoods for observing the evidence if a given hypothesis is assumed to be true).  Advocates argue that formalization can improve analytic transparency, eliminate ambiguity inherent in common language used to describe probabilities, better locate disagreements over interpretation of evidence, and make our reasoning more systematic (Bennett 2015, Humphreys and Jacobs 2015, Rohlfing 2013).  Skeptics contend that because probabilities can rarely be objectively quantified in qualitative research, formalization may create a false sense of precision; moreover, the arbitrariness inherent in quantification can undermine the potential gains from systematically aggregating inferences across multiple observations via Bayes\u2019 rule (Fairfield and Charman 2015).  \n\nIn light of this debate, a fundamental and conceptually prior question should be addressed: does training in Bayesian reasoning change how scholars evaluate evidence and assess alternative hypotheses in qualitative case research?  Would scholars reach different conclusions given a body of evidence depending on whether they reason informally about which hypothesis provides the best explanation, as is most often done in qualitative research, or instead endeavor to evaluate the relative likelihood of the evidence under one hypothesis compared to a rival, and then update their prior degrees of belief in those hypotheses using Bayes\u2019 theorem?

There are four version: a control, an inclusive appeal, a targeted ethnic appeal using explicit language, and a more subtle ethnic appeal. For all respondents, the candidate will be identified as a co-ethnic using common surnames to signal co-ethnicity (the audio recordings will also be made by native speakers from each of the seven largest ethnic groups in Nairobi, and respondents will be matched to co-ethnic actors).

Respondents will be told about two hypothetical candidates who are considering running for office as Councilors, and asked to indicate who they would vote for (again using a secret ballot placed in an envelope).

We implement the design for policies regarding voter fraud and domestic violence. We add two further manipulations to examine the effect of problem prevalence priming and group identification on scope insensitivity.", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "id": "20160615AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "H1: scope manipulation. Overall, we expect to find either strict or limited scope insensitivity in support for policies of varying effectiveness. Strict insensitivity amounts to a hypothesis of no differences across the three groups (1/3, 1/2, and 2/3 reductions in fraudulent voters on registration lists/repeat domestic violence offenses). Although strict insensitivity may materialize, we could also find modest differences\nin support according to the effectiveness of the policy.1 We hypothesize that any differences in support should be larger for initial gains, i.e., larger across the first two conditions (reducing fraud/violence by 1/3 vs. 1/2) than across the second two conditions (reducing fraud/violence by 1/2 vs. 2/3).\nH2-H5: prevalence prime. The prevalence prime serves two purposes: (1) to prime the respondent to think about the size of the problem that the proposed policy addresses and (2) to measure the respondent\u2019s prior on the size of the problem. We expect respondents treated with the prime to support the policy at higher rates than respondents in the control group (H2). Furthermore, we expect respondents with high priors on the prevalence of the issue to support the policy at higher rates than those with lower priors (H3).\nIn addition, we expect individuals treated with the prime to become more scope insensitive; i.e., that differences in support across the scope conditions will decrease relative to those found for the unprimed respondents (H4). We also predict that respondents with high priors will be more scope insensitive than those with lower priors (H5).\nH6-H8: group cue. Drawing attention to harm to the respondent\u2019s ingroup should decrease support for the policy, irrespective of the prevalence prime or scope manipulation (H6). Specifically, we expect that Democrats who receive the group cue will support the voter fraud policy at a lower rate than Democrats in the control group, and that men who receive the group cue will support the domestic violence policy at a lower level than men in the control group.\nWe will also evaluate whether the group cue moderates the degree of scope sensitivity that is manifest among group identifiers. On the one hand, the group cue treatment could increase scrutiny and, thus, scope sensitivity among group identifiers\u2014Democrats and men, respectively, for the vote fraud and domestic violence questions\u2014such that any differences in support across the three proposed policies will be higher for Democrats/men in the treatment group than for Democrats/men in the control group (H7a). On the other hand, by drawing attention to harm to the ingroup, the group cue could spur opposition to the policy regardless of the policy\u2019s effectiveness, resulting in diminished scope sensitivity (H7b).\nWe do not have a clear prediction for outgroup behavior. We see three possibilities: (1) Outgroup respondents receiving the group cue support the policy at a lower rate than the outgroup control respondents. Respondents\u2019 support for the policy decreases when they are made aware of the costs. If this occurs, we expect the decrease to be smaller than the corresponding decrease for the ingroup. (2) Outgroup respondents receiving the group cue support the policy at a higher rate than the outgroup control respondents. With intergroup competition made salient, they have a higher propensity to support the policy since it disadvantages the outgroup. (3) Outgroup respondents receiving the group cue support the policy at the same rate as the outgroup control respondents. The group cue does not affect their perception of the policy, or the effects described in (1) and (2) cancel each other out.\nGiven H6, then if either (2) or (3) are operating we should also see a larger opinion gap between Democrats and Republicans in the treatment (group cue) group than in the control group in the voter fraud experiment (H8 fraud) and a larger opinion gap between men and women in the treatment (group cue) group than in the control group in the domestic violence experiment (H8 domestic violence).", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Scope Insensitivity in Support for Public Policy", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Alexander Sahn, Laura Stoker, Amy Lerman", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "For each policy issue, the design follows a 2x3x2 factorial that yields 12 experimental conditions\u2014each consisting of a unique question wording.

Coordination in many situations requires individuals to risk some of their personal resources in hopes of obtaining a higher payoff if others also contribute. We study whether emotions, in particular fear, affect people's ability to coordinate in taking risky actions. Emotions are patterns of chemical and neural responses to environmental stimuli (Damasio, 1994). Fear, for instance, is controlled by a region of the brain called the amygdala, which triggers the release of the stress hormone cortisol, which causes changes in bodily processes such as heart rate, breathing, and metabolism that prepare an organism for action. The amygdala also triggers changes in higher-level processing in the brain, redirecting working memory to the potential threat and shifting decision-making through risk perceptions, risk preferences, and trust, among other parameters. While this basic dynamic describes many scenarios, we apply this view of decision-making from psychology and neuroscience to study decisions to participate in acts of collective dissent in authoritarian regimes. \nWe build a model based on a global game (Carlsson and Van Damme, 1993; Morris and Shin, 2003, 2004) in which people decide whether or not to take a costly action to overthrow a regime. We argue that fear may reduce participation in collective dissent. In particular, fear may increase pessimism about a signal of the strength of the regime, and it may increase risk aversion. When people are aware that the other players are also in a state of fear, the effects may compound as not only will they themselves be more pessimistic and risk averse, but they will expect that their partner will be as well.\nWe propose to conduct a lab experiment to test the implications of this model. In the lab, we will induce fear in a random subset of participants using an Autobiographical Emotional Memory Task (AEMT) (Lerner and Small, 2008; Myers and Tingley, Forthcoming). This treatment induces emotions by asking participants to write a description of a past experience in which they felt fear, while control participants describe a typical day. After the emotion induction, participants will play 15 rounds of a two-player coordination game. In this game, players will receive a signal of the cost of dissenting with the regime and decide whether to mobilize or not.\n", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": 168.0, "extra": []}, "id": "20160616AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "H1.

Yet post-election surveys routinely over-estimate political interest and turnout, often by large margins. While sampling issues no doubt contribute to these inaccuracies, studies of turnout suggest that misreporting is also a substantial issue, even when surveys are self-administered, either online or on paper (Rivers and Wells 2015; Ansolabehere and Hersch 2012). \n\nThe existing literature relates misreporting to the concept of social desirability bias, which captures the extent to which a survey question elicits answers that are socially (un-)acceptable or (un-)desirable. In most democracies paying attention to politics and voting are considered civic duties and therefore highly desirable behaviours, such that people may be reluctant to admit failing to engage in them. Previous attempts to reduce misreporting rely on a combination of wording and answer strategies (such as forgiving wording and face-saving answering options), as well as anonymity preserving question designs (such as randomized response or the item count technique). Evidence of the effectiveness of these approaches is mixed (Tourangeau & Yan 2007). \n\nIn this study, we unpack the concept of social desirability and assess to what extent misreporting, in the context of a self-administered online survey might be due to self-regarding psychological processes rather than other-regarding motivations. This is done through a series of survey experiments in the immediate aftermath of the upcoming 2016 British EU referendum.\n\nPaulhus (1984, 2002) distinguishes two components of social desirability bias: self-deception and impression management. While self-deception is a relatively unconscious process through which individuals deny their own faults, impression management is a more strategic and conscious process, involving deliberately minimizing one\u2019s mistakes by making excuses and executing other damage control maneuvers. Linking this to the literature on psychological threat and self-integrity (Steele 1988), we argue that misreporting in self-administered online surveys \u2013 where there is no interviewer present for the respondent to impress with their answers (nor, in all likelihood, any other individual who does not already know whether the respondent turned out) \u2013 is likely to be due to self-deception and not impression management. For respondents who did not vote, questions about turnout represent a challenge to the adequacy of the self, leading to defensive responses such as denial and self-deception. Existing strategies for reducing misreporting do not address the self-deception mechanism explicitly, which we believe accounts for their mixed success. \n\nBased on the psychological threat literature we develop two distinct approaches towards reducing misreporting: (1) strengthening and affirming the self (see Cohen and Sherman 2014) and (2) contextualizing the sensitive question to reduce its psychological threat.\n", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": 4000.0, "extra": []}, "id": "20160617AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "The study will assess the performance of the different turnout instruments against actual national and regional turnout rates and against each other to judge their relative performance. \n\nH1: We expect the self-affirmation treatment to reduce turnout misreporting compared to the baseline turnout measure.\n\nH2: We expect the self-affirmation treatment to reduce turnout misreporting compared to the self-affirmation placebo condition.\n\nH3: We expect the contextualization treatment to reduce turnout misreporting compared to the baseline turnout measure.\n\nH4: We expect the contextualization treatment with norm-defiant items to reduce turnout misreporting compared to the baseline turnout measure.\n\nH5: We expect the contextualization treatment with norm-defiant items to reduce turnout misreporting compared to the norm-compliant contextualization treatment.\n", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Reducing Misreporting due to Psychological Threat: An Experimental Design", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "NA", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "NA", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Patrick M Kuhn, Nick Vivyan", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "YouGov Omnibus Surveys", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "We will field a survey experiment to a representative sample of British voters shortly after the EU Referendum on 23 June 2016. The survey will be fielded by YouGov over two waves, yielding a total sample size of 4,000.\n\nRespondents will be randomly assigned to five possible experimental conditions:\n1. Baseline: Standard British Election Study (BES) turnout and political attention question\n2. Self-Affirmation experiment treatment \n3. Self-Affirmation experiment placebo control\n4. Contextualization\n5. Contextualization with norm-defiance\n\nEach of our five hypotheses takes two techniques for eliciting turnout self-reports and predicts that one should reduce turnout misreporting compared to the other. \n\nWe test for the expected differences in misreporting between techniques in two ways: first, by comparing the accuracy of GB turnout estimates generated using each method; second, by comparing the accuracy of regional turnout estimates generated using each method. We also plan to perform additional validation checks where methods are deemed to successfully reduce turnout misreporting compared to current standard approaches. We deal with each of these three approaches in turn.\n\nAccuracy of GB turnout estimates\nFirst, we will generate and compare weighted and un-weighted estimates of national (GB) turnout for each of our five experimental conditions. Our overall sample will be designed to be representative of the GB population and the respondents receiving each experimental condition constitute a random sub-sample from this sample. Therefore, the mean number of self-reported voters in each experimental condition represents an un-weighted estimate of turnout under that condition. To get weighted estimates of turnout for each condition, we will incorporate YouGov\u2019s standard survey weights.\n\nTo allow initial comparison across all of the experimental conditions, we will plot the weighted and un-weighted estimates of turnout under each condition, together with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. \n\nTo test the pairwise comparisons implied by H1-H5 more directly, we will perform five z-tests for differences-in-(weighted-)means: \n\u2022 for H1, baseline vs. self-affirmation treatment \n\u2022 for H2,  self-affirmation placebo vs. self-affirmation treatment\n\u2022 for H3, baseline vs. norm-compliant contextualization \n\u2022 for H4, baseline vs. norm-defiant contextualization\n\u2022 for H5 norm-compliant vs. norm-defiant contextualization\n\nNote that, when interpreting these comparisons, a method which reduces average turnout estimates compared to the standard turnout question is taken to reduce turnout misreporting. This assumes that the reduction in estimated turnout results from a reduction in the number of non-voting respondents who nevertheless report voting.\n\nAccuracy of regional turnout estimates\nOur comparisons of GB turnout estimates under the different experimental conditions can be considered our \u2018headline\u2019 results, but a method might reduce average turnout estimates for the wrong reasons. How can we check that this is not happening? Ideally, we would use validated measures of respondent turnout to do this: armed with validated turnout measures for each respondent, we could further test our hypotheses by checking whether the number of non-voting respondents who nevertheless report voting declines as expected.  Unfortunately, we do not envisage having access to validated voting measures for individual respondents, as we are unaware of a validated vote study taking place following the EU referendum.\n\nBut while we cannot observe the true turnout behavior of individual survey respondents, we can nevertheless observe true turnout behavior at levels of aggregation that are lower than the national level. We will take advantage of this to test our hypotheses at lower levels of aggregation. Specifically, for each experimental condition we will estimate referendum turnout rates in each of the eleven Government Office Regions of Britain, and compare these estimates to each other and to the known referendum turnout rates in each region.\n\nWe will obtain region identifiers for each respondent from YouGov. However, disaggregating the respondents in each of our five experimental according to their region of residence will leave a relatively small number of observations in each condition-region sub-sample: with 800 respondents in each experimental condition and 11 regions, we would have on average 73 respondents in each group. To overcome problems of noise and sampling error in such sparse sub-samples, we will generate our regional estimates of turnout multilevel regression and poststratification using (MRP) (Park, Gelman and Bafumi 2004; Lax and Philips 2009), as follows:\n\n\u2022 Step 1. Estimate a logistic regression model of turnout as a function of respondent demographic characteristics (gender, age group, social grade, highest educational qualification), with intercepts that vary randomly by region and by experimental condition.\n\n\u2022 Step 2. Based on the model from Step 1, generate fitted probabilities of turnout for each possible demographic type of respondent (as defined by the demographic predictors in the regression) in each possible region and under each possible experimental condition.\n\n\u2022 Step 3. For each combination of region and experimental condition, generate an estimated turnout rate via a weighted average of the fitted probabilities from step 2, weighted according to the number of people of each demographic \u2018type\u2019 in the region (as observed from census data).\n\nThis process will yield five estimates of EU referendum turnout for each region. We will first compare the five estimates for each region (and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals) graphically. We will then perform more systematic tests of Hypotheses H1-H5 by comparing posterior distributions: specifically, for each pairwise comparison implied by each individual hypothesis, we will calculate the number of regions for which we can be 95% confident (based on draws from the posterior distribution) that the predicted turnout rate under one condition is lower than that under the other condition. For example, with respect to H1, we would calculate the number of regions for which we can say with 95% confidence that predicted turnout under the self-affirmation treatment is lower than that under the standard turnout question. We will also compute the mean, median, and maximum difference in predicted turnout rates across regions, for each pairwise comparison of methods.\n\nAdditional validation checks\nWhere experimental treatments appear to correct turnout misreporting according to inspection of national and regional turnout estimates, we will also perform additional validation checks.\n\nFirst, we will inspect item nonresponse and `don\u2019t know\u2019 rates under each experimental condition. One possibility is that some methods might reduce turnout estimates only by increasing item nonresponse, particularly among those who would normally report voting under a standard turnout question.\n\nSecond, we will estimate demographic models of turnout under each experimental condition, regressing self-reported turnout on self-reported party identification, gender, age group, and highest education qualification. This will result in five models of turnout, which can be compared to each other and to a benchmark model of turnout estimated based on validated vote data from the 2015 British Election Study. \n\nOne drawback with this benchmark, is that the mechanisms determining turnout (and by implication mis-reporting) are likely to be different for the EU referendum compared to the 2015 General Election. (For example, in the case of the EU referendum, party cues are much weaker in this campaign, and therefore the relationship between party ID and turnout may be different to the 2015 General Election). However, in the absence of validated vote data for the EU referendum, the 2015 validated vote model will at least serve as a benchmark against which we can compare our experiment-based models, to see whether the demographic patterns in turnout are broadly consistent across the different models. \n", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": 42643.0, "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "United Kingdom", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Registration prior to assignment of treatment", "extra": []}, "timestamp": "06/17/2016 - 06:26"}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": 42545.0, "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "This study evaluates the role of international governmental organizations (IGOs) for preventing the escalation of political disputes between states.

With the spread of low-cost hand-held phones to all corners of the globe, the impact of the mobile technology revolution on politics is of great importance. Existing observational studies generally find a positive association between mobile communication and civic and political participation (Campbell and Kwak 2010; Lee et al. 2014), including on violent and non-violent mobilization (Pierskalla and Hollenbach 2013; Manacorda and Tesei 2016).  There have been fewer experimental studies, however, on the effect of mobile phone ownership on political engagement. Those studies that have been undertaken focus almost exclusively on the effect of Short Message Service (SMS) texts, or text messages, on inducing voter turnout (Dale and Strauss 2009; Malhotra et al. 2011), shaping vote choice (Buntaine, Bush, Jablonski, Nielson, and Pickering 2016) and eliciting citizen feedback (Grossman et al. 2015a; Grossman et al. 2015b).  As a cheap and efficient means to disseminate information in bulk, mobile messaging has been embraced by international organizations, non-governmental organizations, governments and private corporations to reach out to a large number of end-users. In the political realm, this transformation in the intensity and extensity of information exchange between citizens and their governments, especially in non-democratic states where such linkages are traditionally weak, may help to strengthen the citizen-government feedback loop that underpins political accountability (Bailur and Gigler 2014). \n\nHowever, existing experimental research probing the effects of mobile-based informational campaigns on political or civic engagement rarely takes into consideration the mediating effects phone ownership may have. Who holds the phone likely affects who receives information and ultimately who participates in political and civic life. This matters because critical disparities in mobile phone ownership exist both across society and within households. According to existing research, women are 14 percent less likely to own a mobile phone than men in low or middle-income countries (GSMA 2015). The gap is even starker among rural women or between literate and illiterate individuals. One broader implication of this digital divide is informational campaigns designed to empower citizens and improve political accountability may be further marginalizing the marginalized and reinforcing or even worsening social inequality.\n\nThis study represents the first field experiment to examine the effect of heterogeneous phone ownership on the efficacy of a mobile technology-based informational campaign on inducing civic engagement. Building on the random assignment of mobile phone handsets and SIM cards to a sub-sample of 400 female non-phone owners in December 2015 in rural Tanzania (Roessler, Myamba, Carroll and Nielson 2016), participants will be invited to a land rights workshop to be held at the end of June 2016. All participants will be invited to the land rights workshop via SMS and a follow-up phone call in the same manner\u2014via their best contact, which is their own SIM card if they own a mobile phone or if they don\u2019t own a mobile phone, the number of a family member, friend, or neighbor that they provided us (their alternate contact). The previous random assignment of mobile phones in December 2015 allows us to rigorously test how the impact of mobile phone ownership affects rural women\u2019s participation in a workshop to learn how to secure their land rights through the existing legal and political systems.  \n\nOur primary analysis leverages the random assignment of phones to identify differences between the phone group, cash placebo and control on our key outcomes: receiving the invitation, signing up for the land rights workshop (both the count of who signs up and how long it takes them to sign up), attendance and participation in the workshop. We will also analyze sub-group effects, including: whether literacy affects overall participation, including of those in the phone group; whether the some 40% of participants in the cash group who bought phones with their cash transfers are more likely to learn of the event, sign-up, and attend the training workshop; whether the gender, relationship, and proximity of the best contact matters for those in the non-phone groups who receive the invitation indirectly; and whether there appear to be spillovers in which those in the non-phone groups are more likely to have learned of the training from others in the phone group. Among those in the phone group, we will also analyze whether more active phone users are more likely to participate, as measured by the study outcomes, compared with less active phone users. It is important to note that some women who were randomly assigned to the phone condition at baseline no longer possessed them at endline, many women in the cash placebo condition used their cash to purchase phones, and some women in the control condition acquired phones in the intervening five months. In experimental terms, this suggests double-sided non-compliance. Thus, the design enables both the assessment of the intent-to-treat effects as well as the complier-average-causal effects or treatment effects on the treated (Gerber and Green 2012). It therefore enables the isolation of the effects of phone ownership on responsiveness to invitations for civic engagement.\n\nThe rest of this pre-analysis plan is as follows: we motivate why the ownership of mobile phones has political implications; we then provide hypotheses about the effect of mobile phone ownership and detail a research design and protocol to test these hypotheses, including the invitation language and a description of outcomes; finally, we discuss how we will estimate treatment effects.\n\n\n\n2-Motivation\n\nAs mobile phone ownership has become increasingly common in the developing world, governments, NGOs, and international organizations have turned to mobile communication as a means to engage and disseminate information to the public. For example, in Uganda, UNICEF has started a service, U-Report, that allows citizens to send free SMS text messages on public issues such as health, education, and disease outbreaks, with the goal of aggregating citizen preferences and grievances to enable the Ugandan government to better serve its constituents (UNICEF 2005; Blaschke et al. 2013). During the Ebola health crisis in West Africa, the United States\u2019 Centers for Disease Control partnered with major telecommunications companies in the affected countries to disseminate information, including via text messages (or SMS), on how Ebola is spread. Mobile outreach and engagement has enormous potential to deepen linkages between governments (and other service providers) and citizens, and to strengthen the feedback loop that underpins political accountability (Bailur and Gigler 2014). But mobile technology\u2019s promise to close the feedback loop hinges critically on the structure of mobile phone ownership. Who holds the phone determines whose voice is heard and who receives public information. \n\nUnequal phone ownership poses a problem for feedback loops that rely on mobile technology. In developing countries, where women are significantly less likely to own phones compared to men (GSMA 2015), organizations that seek to disseminate and gather information risk skewed reach and feedback. In Ghana, the Grameen Foundation\u2019s MOTECH project sought to use mobile phones to provide health information to pregnant women, but discovered the information was not reaching the intended beneficiaries because it was not being shared by male phone owners (Gates 2014). In Uganda, men were twice as likely as women to enroll in the free UNICEF-Uganda citizen-polling platform, U-Report.  In two studies on mobile outreach in Uganda\u2014one an HIV/AIDS awareness campaign and the other to elicit citizen feedback on taxation\u2014among registered users, the response rate among men was more than twice that compared to women (Chib et al. 2012; Grossman et al. 2015a). The upshot, as one review article analyzing this problem in the mHealth field concludes, is: \u201cmobile-based programs may inadvertently reinforce the digital divide, particularly in terms of access to information\u201d (Jennings and Gagliardi 2013).\n\nA number of factors may account for the low-levels of female participation in mobile-based programming. Consistent with other types of political participation, it could be due to structural differences in economic resources, lower levels of efficacy resulting from clientelism, gender norms or restricted civil liberties (Isaksson et al. 2014); in this study we focus on the direct effect control of technology plays. Our intuition is that unequal mobile phone ownership hinders women\u2019s ability to participate in mobile-based programming. Those who do not personally own a phone, but otherwise want to take advantage of programming and information disseminated through mobile technology, have to rely on others who own phones, such as family members, friends, or neighbors, to pass along messages and calls that are intended for them. Quite ironically like a game of telephone, receiving information second-hand can distort the content of the message or prevent it from reaching the intended recipient at all. This interruption of the flow of information occurs for a wide range of reasons, including human foibles (e.g., forgetfulness), geographic distance between phone holder and intended recipient, or due to the discretionary power of the phone holder\u2014in which they act as information gatekeepers and decide whether or not to pass along the message to the intended recipient.\n\nHeretofore, there has been little systematic research on the impact of mobile phone ownership on public mobile campaigns\u2014especially related to gender disparities. Because we are able to leverage the random assignment of phones from the prior separate study, we are uniquely positioned to measure the effect of phone ownership on female participation in a politically relevant gathering. Unlike the breadth of literature on mobile messaging campaigns, our downstream experimental design (Green and Gerber 2002) allows us to estimate the causal effect of phone ownership on participation. By exogenously assigning mobile ownership, we are able to isolate the influence of ownership on participation from the other related causes. \n\nWe test the impact of mobile phone ownership on civic engagement in the context of a land rights training workshop held by the Tanzanian non-governmental organization, HAKIARDHI. A training workshop on land rights and land tenure makes a good test of direct mobile communication on female civic engagement as prevailing patriarchal norms and interests may affect women\u2019s ability to learn about such opportunities. While formally women\u2019s right to own and inherit land is safeguarded by the 1999 Tanzanian Land Act, in many communities customary practices based on patrilineal principles continue to prevail. Thus, in the case of divorce or death of their husbands women are often denied from inheriting land (Duncan 2015). As a land rights advocacy organization, HAKIARDHI holds a number of training workshops, including those for women to educate them about their legal protections and how to act on their rights. Based on a survey we conducted in May 2016 with the participants, it is clear they see this issue as an important one and are intrinsically interested in learning more about it. In that survey, more than 80% of the respondents viewed lack of equal rights to own and inherit land as an important issue women in Tanzania face and nearly 90% of the participants said they would be interested in attending a workshop to learn more about land and inheritance rights for women.

We also expect higher interest and attendance among: phone owners with higher literacy and socio-economic levels, study participants in the cash and control groups who purchased their own phones, those without phones whose best contact is also female and more socially connected to them, and those in the phone group who are more active users of their phones, as measured by phone usage data from cell service provider, Tigo. From these expectations we develop the following hypotheses:\n\nPrimary Hypotheses\n\n \nH1: Mobile phone ownership will increase the likelihood that participants  sign-up for the land rights workshop compared to the control and cash groups.\n\nH2: Mobile phone ownership will reduce the time it takes for participants to register for the land rights workshop compared to the control and cash groups.\n\nH3: Mobile phone ownership will increase the likelihood that participants attend the land rights workshop compared to the control and cash groups.\n\n\nSecondary Hypotheses\n\n\nH4: The effects of mobile phone ownership tested in H1 through H3 will be more pronounced among participants in the cash and control groups who purchased phones during the period of our study compared to those who did not purchase a phone in the cash and control group.\n\nH5: The effects of mobile phone ownership tested in H1 through H3 will be more pronounced among participants with higher literacy and socio-economic levels, compared to participants with lower literacy and socio-economic levels.\n\nH6: The effects of mobile phone ownership tested in H1 through H3 will be more pronounced among participants in the phone group who are active users of their phone, compared to participants who are less active users.\n", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Mobile Phone Ownership and Civic Participation: A Field Experiment in Tanzania", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Philip Roessler, Flora Myamba, Peter Carroll, Daniel Nielson", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Researchers", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "Exogenous variation in mobile phone ownership\n\nThis study builds on an existing randomized controlled trial we have conducted in Tanzania, \"Mobile Phones and Women's Empowerment: Phase II of a Field Experiment\"  among 400 female Tanzanian non-phone owners from the regions of Rufiji and Kilwa (south of Dar es Salaam by 175 kilometers and 322 kilometers, respectively) (Roessler, Myamba, Carroll and Nielson 2016). The RCT, launched in December 2015 (for a timeline of program events see Appendix 1),  entailed the random assignment of 150 participants to a phone group, in which they attended a mobile technology training workshop, received a cost-free Nokia 105 handset, a Tigo sim card, and 10,000 Tanzania Shillings (or roughly $5) in start-up credit. Another 100 were assigned to a cash group, in which participants received the same value as the phone package ($23) in the form of a lump sum unconditional cash transfer. A final 150 participants were assigned to the wait-list control group, in which they will receive a cash grant or phone at the completion of the study (slated for July 2016). \n\nThe exogenous variation in phone ownership arising from the randomization procedures enables us to rigorously test how phone ownership affects subjects\u2019 ability to learn about and attend a land rights training workshop. To test this, we have partnered again with the Journalists Environmental Association of Tanzania (JET) as well as one of its partners, HAKIRARDHI (the Land Rights Research and Resources Institute). As JET helped to recruit all participants into the original field experiment, assisted with distribution of the phones and cash grants at baseline and will help to distribute phones and cash grants to the participants at endline, HAKIARDHI is leading the training at the workshop and all promotion of the workshop. HAKIARDHI has held land rights training events in Rufiji and Kilwa in the past.\n\nMobile-based Programming Outreach and Heterogeneous Phone Ownership\n\nLike other organizations, HAKIARDHI has turned to mobile communication to reduce costs in participant recruitment. The organization sends out SMS and conducts follow-up phone calls to invitees to its programming. Thus in reaching out to the subjects in our study through mobile communication, this represents a natural means of participant outreach. \n\nOne challenge organizations like HAKIARDHI face in their outreach is that not all potential participants own a phone or SIM card. Traditionally, organizations such as our partner JET, tap into local networks to find and recruit citizens who cannot be reached by mobile phone for their programming. This entails contacting well-connected individuals in local villages, such as the chairmen of community-based organizations, paying them a facilitator fee, and covering their transport costs as they go house-to-house to recruit specific individuals. There are several downsides to this approach. First, it is costly, especially the transport expenses. Second, the NGOs face principal-agent problems. Without close monitoring, the chairmen may turn to individuals with whom they have personal ties or others in their own network to invite to the program. \n\nAn alternative to using local runners to contact those without phones is to leverage phone sharing as a means to recruit mobile-less participants. Even if a given person may not have a phone, as discussed above, they often know someone\u2014a family member, friend or neighbor\u2014who has a phone who they deem their alternative best contact and through whom they can receive calls or messages. Thus for those without phones, mobile-based programming information intended for them often goes to someone they know who has a phone. \n\nIn this study, working with HAKIARDHI, we aim to directly reach out to the subjects in our original experiment and invite them to a land rights training workshop\u2014one of which will be held in Kilwa Masoko on June 28 and the other to be held in Rufiji on June 30. In contacting the participants, we aim to reach them as directly as possible and thus give each person the same opportunity to learn about the workshop. For those who own phones (whether in phone group, cash group or control) as of May 2016 (when we conducted a survey with all participants), we will contact them via the phone number associated with their primary SIM card.  For those who do not own phones, we will contact them via the phone number they report as the best contact on which to reach them.   \n\nFollowing from our phone distribution in December 2015, there is significant variation in phone ownership across study groups. But the variation is not perfectly correlated with the phone distribution. A few in the control group obtained phones since the start of the experiment; an even greater number in the cash group obtained phones as they leveraged their cash grants to buy phones. In the phone group, phone ownership as of May was more than 90%, suggesting potentially meaningful non-compliance, but only 70% in the phone provided us with a SIM number. This discrepancy is puzzling but may partially be due to some respondents not remembering their phone number.\n\n\n\nMobile-based Invitation Protocol\n\nAll the participants will be contacted via an online mass SMS text messaging platform called \u201cFrontlineSMS.\u201d   This system has an online interface that sends mass customized messages, including the addition of the recipient\u2019s name in the message .  It is compatible with the major cell service carriers in Tanzania such as Tigo, Vodacom, and Airtel. It also provides information on whether messages are delivered and allows one to customize the sent number so participants can respond directly. As a majority of the participants in the study have a Tigo SIM card, we programmed a Tigo number as the reply number.  \n\nParticipants in the study will initially receive two invitational text messages in successive days (10 or 12 days before the training workshops). Then each person will receive a follow-up phone call (7 or 9 days before the training workshop) and a reminder text message the day before the workshop.\n\nAgain as explained above, subjects in the phone group will receive the messages and call to either the first SIM provided to those who own phones or, for those who do not own phones, to an alternate contact, such as a family member or friend. Three messages will be sent (two initial messages and a reminder message) will explain the details of the workshop.  All participants will receive one phone call. The script for the text messages and phone calls, as well as a protocol for the information we provide in response to questions, is found below. We also anticipated common questions and responses to these questions, which we include in the appendix.\n\nThe first text message will be sent on June 18, 2016 to all participants of the study. It reads:\n\nIn Kiswahili:\n\nHabari [name] HAKIARDHI , haki za ardhi shirika la utetezi wa taifa, ni kuwakaribisha wewe mafunzo juu ya masuala ya haki za ardhi, umiliki wa ardhi na nchi dhamana kupata mikopo ya fedha kwenye [28/06/2016 / 30/06/2016] katika [Serengeti /Kwamiwa] saa tatu asubuhi hadi saa nane mchana. Kutakua na chakula na nauli ya usafiri wa umma itatolewa. Thibitisha ushiriki wako kupitia namba [number of on call field assistant]\n\nIn English:\nA message for [name]\n\nHello [name], HAKIARDHI, a national land rights advocacy organization, is inviting you to a training on issues of land rights, land tenure and land collateral for loans from financial institutions on [28/06/2016 / 30/06/2016] at [Serengeti Hall/Kwamiwa Hall] at 9:00 a.m. Lunch will be served and public transport cost will be provided. Confirm you participation through this number: [number of on call field assistant].\n\nThe second text message will be sent on June 16th to all participants.  It reads the exact same as the first text message sent.\n\nThree days after the initial message, we will hold a phone bank and call every participant.  This allows us to confirm that our message was received and read. The phone banks will be conducted by REPOA field assistants who will adhere to a strict script when addressing participants and answering questions. The script will read as follows:\n\nHello!\n\nAm I speaking to [name]? \n\nIf yes . . .\n1. HAKIARDHI, a national land rights advocacy organization, has invited you to a training on issues of land rights, land tenure and land collateral to access loans from financial institutions on [28/06/2016 / 30/06/2016] at [Serengeti Hall/Kwamiwa] at 9:00 a.m. Lunch will be served and public transport cost will be provided. \nCan I confirm your attendance?  \n\nIf yes  . . .\na. Thank you - we look forward to seeing you there!\nIf no . . . \nb. Is there a reason you can not attend?  [record reason]  Thank you for your time.  Goodbye.  \nIf no . . . \n2. Can I please speak to her?\n\nIf yes . . . \na. Hello, [name]!  \nHAKIARDHI, a national land rights advocacy organization, has invited you to a training on issues of land rights, land tenure and land collateral to access loans from financial institutions on [28/06/2016 / 30/06/2016] at [Serengeti Hall/Kwamiwa] at 9:00 a.m. Lunch will be served and public transport cost will be provided. \nCan I confirm your attendance? \n\nIf yes  . . .\ni. Thank you - we look forward to seeing you there!\nIf no . . . \nii. Is there a reason you can not attend?  [record reason]  Thank you for your time.  Goodbye.\nIf no/unavailable . . . \nb. Is there a better time I could call back? [record time]\n Thank you for your time!\n\nThree days prior to each workshop, the participants who have confirmed attendance will receive an SMS text message reminder that will again share the details of the workshop.  This message will read: \n\nREMINDER:  Hello [name], you have confirmed attendance to a training on land rights and land tenure with HAKIARDHI on [28/06/2016 / 30/06/2016] at [Serengeti Hall/Kilwa location] at 9:00 a.m. \n\nLand rights workshops\n\nThe land rights workshop in Rufiji will be held at Serengeti Hall at 9 a.m on June 28th.  The land rights workshop in Kilwa will be held at Kwamiwa Hall at 9 a.m on June 30th. The workshops will focus specifically on women\u2019s issues when it comes to property ownership and the use of land as collateral. As noted above, Tanzanian women have de jure equality with men under existing land laws, yet face heavy discrimination in practice. The workshop will attempt to address avenues by which women can settle land disputes, specifically educating them about legal recourses to ensure that they are fairly treated. The workshop will also focus on women\u2019s limited access to banks and other financial institutions, and how to safely use land as collateral in order to receive loans. \n\n\n\nMeasuring outcomes \n\nWho signs up\nWe can easily measure this by recording who texts or calls back, confirming that they will be attending the workshop. In addition, we can also record when responses are received, to measure whether the treatment has any effect on the timing of the response. \n\nWho attends workshop\nWe will prepare a list of all 400 women in our original experiment, and note on that list whether the woman had confirmed her attendance. We will then check off each woman as she registers in person at the workshop. \n\nParticipation at workshop\nDuring the workshop, we will measure the participation of those who attend the workshop, including the duration of comments and number of times that attendees comment at the workshop.\n\nDebriefing survey\nFollowing the workshop, we will ask each attendee to complete a short survey. The survey instrument will evaluate the attendees understanding of the workshop and willingess to take action in the area of the workshop topic of land rights.\n\nTigo SIM usage data\nBecause of our partnership with Tigo, we are able to access anonymized usage data for women in our study for the six months prior to the workshop. This data includes frequency of SMS and call transmissions, mobile money and data use, data amount used, and whether the account is active. \n\nEstimation of Treatment Effects\n\nSimple difference-in-means analysis for the outcome measures \u2013 workshop signup, timeliness of signup, attendance, participation, and survey measures \u2013 will be performed comparing the phone treatment group in Roessler et al. 2016 to the waitlist control and cash placebo groups. Regression analysis with demographic covariates will supplement the analysis. This analysis will focus on the intent to treat with random assignment to experimental conditions functioning as the key causal variable in analysis.\n\nAdditionally, complier-average causal effects will be computed accounting for double-sided non-compliance. That is, some women assigned to receive phones in the treatment group no longer possessed them at endline, some women in the waitlist control acquired phones between baseline and endline, and many women in the cash placebo group used the cash to purchase phones. Due to this measured non-compliance, the treatment effect on the treated is therefore also of interest. This analysis will also be performed with and without the inclusion of demographic covariates as controls.\n\nSubgroup analysis through difference-in-means tests and employing regression with covariates will also be undertaken as outlined in the hypotheses. The subject pool will be partitioned into high and low literacy/education groups, active and less-active phone users, and phone and non-phone owners.\n", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "Tanzania", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Registration prior to any research activities", "extra": []}, "timestamp": "06/18/2016 - 00:00"}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": 42536.0, "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "Our study is a two-wave survey experiment that tests two kinds of treatments on attitudes towards gun control.

And what sustains them?  This project examines the causes of sudden increases in migration through an original survey and embedded experiment of migrants and potential migrants in Turkey, Jordan, Syria, and Iraq.  Conventional wisdom is that violence and economic deprivation spark migrant waves.  However, a number of empirical anomalies emerge in violence-based theories: migrants come from countries and regions that have experienced long-standing conflicts, and often few changes in violence can be detected that would spark a sudden migrant wave.  We instead propose an alternative explanation rooted in what migrants understand about policy in receiving countries.  We suspect that there is a political cycle of migration in which individuals initially suspect that a large number of migrants will be met with a sympathetic response in receiving countries, only to be followed by a policy closure in which public and political pressure leads receiving countries to close their borders.

We expect that information about the large size of migrant flows, as well as their sympathetic composition, make survey respondents more likely to believe that European governments will respond in a sympathetic way to migrants and to want to migrate (or tell friends to migrate).  The direct provision of information about the sympathy or hostility of the European policy environment, in contrast, will lead to different expectations about migrants' treatment.

Revenues may differ not only in where they come from but also in how they are tracked, distributed, and managed. Existing studies have, in general, paid little attention to these institutional differences, or attempted to distinguish between effects driven by such differences and those driven by psychological mechanisms such as the endowment effect. To remedy this, we propose a lab-in-the-field experiment that varies both the source of revenue from which spending is financed. The experiment will follow the Maritn (2014) design, in which the author utilized laboratory experiments in Uganda to measure the existence of a loss aversion mechanism after citizens pay taxes.

While high emotions during campaigns are nothing new, pundits and scholars are now regularly claiming this cycle sets a high water mark for the use and impact of emotional political rhetoric. This project will empirically evaluate the role of emotion in the current political moment. We propose a simple experimental test of competing hypothesis about the power of fear vs anger in driving subsets of voters toward populist, nationalist candidacies like Donald Trump\u2019s. Contrary to much conventional wisdom, we have pilot data demonstrating that Trump\u2019s support does not derive from anxiety among authoritarians, ethnocentrists or sexists. In fact, when these citizens experience fear, their support for Trump declines precipitously. Anger, on the other hand, seems to powerfully galvanize support for Trump (but not other Republican candidates), especially among those who score highly on measures of ethnocentrism and sexism (results for authoritarians were not significant, given the small portion of authoritarians in the sample).\nOne of the more common narratives in the current political blogosphere involves the fear messages used in this election: The surprisingly successful campaign to date of non-establishment candidate Donald Trump is due to his ability to capitalize on authoritarian, ethnocentric or sexist fears about \u201cothers\u201d: immigrants, Muslims, women, other minorities, etc. Where do these fears come from? Perhaps they are rooted in economic insecurity and the shifting demographic and social structure in America. Authoritarian populists like Trump, therefore, are simply preying on the economic insecurity of many working and lower middle class white voters (Stenner 2005; Hetherington and Weiler 2009). By scapegoating minorities, then, fear can drive up support for these leaders. In sum, according to this view, support for candidates like Trump in the U.S. and other candidates of the far right in Europe is grounded mostly in anxiety about outgroups, and will therefore be maximized when fear is triggered among those with the most negative outgroup attitudes.\nHowever, two related arguments in the literature on the politics of emotion strongly contradict these predictions, and lead us to suggest fear will not be a powerful driver of support for right wing populists like Trump. First, according to cognitive appraisal theories of emotion, fear results when threats are appraised as powerful and uncontrollable (Frijda 1986; Roseman 1984; Lazarus 1991; Scherer 1999). The experience of fear should lead people to withdraw from the situation and carefully consider how they might cope with the threat.  Affective Intelligence Theory (Marcus, Neuman & McKuen 2000) makes a similar prediction about anxiety: It should orient the brain to new information regarding the threat and away from habitual views, such as predispositions toward out-groups. Second, some evidence suggests that specific emotions and particular group attitudes can become linked as a result of socialization processes, and in the U.S. the strongest emotional substrate for racial attitudes is anger, not fear (Banks & Valentino 2012; Banks 2014). \nFearmongering, we therefore predict, is not likely to galvanize support for candidates among those high in ethnocentrism, authoritarianism or sexism. Anger, on the other hand, should galvanize voters with strong predispositions toward the parties and these groups: It should boost support for Trump among strong Republicans and those scoring high on authoritarianism, ethnocentrism and sexism. Our research is thus an attempt to adjudicate between these two competing causal stories \u2013 are Trump voters driven primarily by fear, anger, or is the emotional content of his message irrelevant to his success?", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": 600.0, "extra": []}, "id": "20160625AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "H1: Authoritarians in the anger condition are more likely to support Trump than those in the fear or control conditions.\nH2: Sexists in the anger condition are more likely to support Trump than those in the fear or control conditions.\nH3: Ethnocentrists in the anger condition are more likely to support Trump than those in the fear or control conditions.\nH4: Republicans in the anger condition are more likely to support Trump than those in the fear or control conditions.\nH5: Conservatives in the anger condition are more likely to support Trump than those in the fear or control conditions.\n\nH6: Authoritarians in the anger condition are more likely to participate than those in the fear or control conditions.\nH7: Sexists in the anger condition are more likely to participate than those in the fear or control conditions.\nH8: Ethnocentrists in the anger condition are more likely to participate than those in the fear or control conditions.\nH9: Republicans in the anger condition are more likely to participate than those in the fear or control conditions.\nH10: Conservatives in the anger condition are more likely to participate than those in the fear or control conditions.\n\nH11: Authoritarians in the anger condition are more likely to tradeoff civil liberties than those in the fear or control conditions.\nH12: Ethnocentrists in the anger condition are more likely to tradeoff civil liberties than those in the fear or control conditions.\nH13: Republicans in the anger condition are more likely to tradeoff civil liberties than those in the fear or control conditions.\nH14: Conservatives in the anger condition are more likely t0 tradeoff civil liberties than those in the fear or control conditions.\n\nH15: Authoritarians in the anger condition are more likely to support a Muslim ban than those in the fear or control conditions.\nH16: Ethnocentrists in the anger condition are more likely to support a Muslim ban than those in the fear or control conditions.\nH17: Republicans in the anger condition are more likely to support a Muslim ban than those in the fear or control conditions.\nH18: Conservatives in the anger condition are more likely to support a Muslim ban than those in the fear or control conditions.\n\nH19: Authoritarians in the anger condition are more likely to support a border wall than those in the fear or control conditions.\nH20: Ethnocentrists in the anger condition are more likely to support a border wall than those in the fear or control conditions.\nH21: Republicans in the anger condition are more likely to support a border wall than those in the fear or control conditions.\nH22: Conservatives in the anger condition are more likely to support a border wall than those in the fear or control conditions.\n\nH23: Sexists in the fear condition are more likely to support Bernie Sanders than those in the anger or control conditions.\n", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "The Emotional Substrates of Support for Authoritarian Populists", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": 42424.0, "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "HUM00112667", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Nicholas Valentino, Carly Wayne, Marzia Oceno", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "GfK Knowledge Networks", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "Details can be found in the pre-analysis plan.

Opinion polls are very important as they constitute one of the major communicative pathways of public opinion. Whereas extensive research has examined effects of polls on attitudes (e.g. bandwagon and underdog) as well as behavior (e.g. turnout, voting preferences), our understanding of the mechanisms that mediate how the public engages with polls (perceptions and credibility evaluations of polls) is rather limited. Especially in the context of horse-race journalism in the election years, media reports are saturated with poll reports, which have either consistent or inconsistent results, have varying methodological qualities, and are often interpreted along with heavy partisan or expert commentaries from polling pundits.\n\nThe current study proposes a survey experiment designed to leverage the horse-race dynamics in the 2016 elections. Specifically, we will examine how individuals perceive, evaluate, and react to polls by manipulating multiple polls\u2019 results, their methodological quality, and partisan and expert opinionation of the findings in hypothetical poll reports. We investigate how the public perceive and react to polls. We draw from literatures on motivated reasoning, correctives/fact-checking and opinionated news in formulating our research questions and hypotheses. \n\nSee the attached Additional Documentation for theoretical background.\n", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": 2078.0, "extra": []}, "id": "20160629AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "Please refer to Table 1 in the Additional Document attached for the list of manipulations.\n\nThe 12 conditions proposed will allow us to test eight substantive hypotheses and two research questions. Our first set of hypotheses concern the presence of motivated reasoning and how it depends on poll quality. First, we expect to find evidence that motivated reasoning operates when respondents simultaneously encounter conflicting poll results (H1). We plan to test this by looking at differences in the perceptions of polls in condition C1 by partisanship (See Table 1). Next, we expect that partisans will differ from one another in the credibility that they associate with polls that have consistent results (H2; C2 and C3 by partisanship). These same conditions will allow us to answer our first research question: Do people recognize methodological quality differences between polls with consistent results? (RQ1; C2 and C3). When polls are inconsistent, however, we expect that individuals will be responsive to methodological quality (H3; C4 and C5). Whether variations in methodological quality will enhance or mitigate motivational biases in conflicting polls is a key question (RQ2; C4 and C5 by partisanship vs C1 by partisanship). Compared to conditions where poll results are consistent, we expect that inconsistent results will trigger stronger methods-based assessments (H4; C4 and C5 by partisanship vs C2 and C3 by partisanship). \n\nOur second set of hypotheses concern how commentary on polls might further moderate poll evaluations. Because out-partisans can latch onto expert critiques to dismiss disliked results, we expect that expert commentary will enhance motivated reasoning for polls with consistent findings (H5; C6 and C7 by partisanship vs C2 and C3 by partisanship). In contrast, we expect that expert commentary will reduce motivational biases where polls\u2019 results are inconsistent, because they will serve as an informational corrective (H6; C8 and C9 by partisanship vs C4 and C5 by partisanship). Partisan commentary, on the other hand, should enhance motivated reasoning (H7; C10 and C11 by partisanship vs C1). Finally, we included an additional condition in which an expert critiques conflicting polls both of which are high quality. In this condition, we expect the effects of motivational biases will be stronger than in a condition without expert commentary (H8; C12 vs C1). This final condition is also important for ecological validity reasons as the entire polling industry has increasingly come under fire.  \n\nAcross all of the conditions, we expect to replicate the earlier studies\u2019 findings that more politically aware respondents will be the most susceptible to motivational biases; we plan to use education and party strength to test this. Aside from the respondents\u2019 perceptions of accuracy, we will also examine whether our manipulations alter respondents\u2019 perceptions of likely election outcomes.\n", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Competitive and Opinionated Coverage of the Elections", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": 42447.0, "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": " HUM00113718 ", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Ozan Kuru, Josh Pasek, Michael Traugott", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Researchers", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "We plan to employ OLS and logit analyses to estimate the two outcome variables (relative credibility of messages and election outcome predictions).", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": 42887.0, "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "United States", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Registration prior to researcher analysis of outcome data", "extra": []}, "timestamp": "06/29/2016 - 20:41"}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": 42551.0, "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "This project examines the effects of party-sponsored frames on public opinion and attitudes with regard to rooftop solar panels.

First, partisans may, after receiving a same-ideology frame, be more likely to associate rooftop solar promoting policy with the value expressed in that frame. Second, partisans offered a same-ideology frame may be receiving an implicit party cue that their party is supportive of rooftop solar. This mechanism is tested in the final two questions, where the respondents are asked to place the two parties on a 7-point scale. If the frame ideology provides an implicit party cue, then partisans receiving a same-ideology frame will be more likely to place their party as supportive of rooftop solar promoting policy than those receiving a cross-ideology frame (H4).

The topic of discussion for these focus groups centered on the killing of a neutralized Palestinian attacker by an Israeli soldier in March, 2016, and specifically addressed whether or not the soldier\u2019s actions should have been condemned by prominent Israeli political and military leaders as it was. The experimental treatment was delivered through a confederate who participated in these groups as if he were also a research subject. In a third of the groups, the confederate took a neutral position; in the other two-thirds, he argued in favor of condemnation from either a moralistic or group-interested frame. To measure the effect of these frames, after the focus group, participants provided measures of their willingness to engage in ingroup criticism themselves, their approval of criticism coming from other ingroup members, and their willingness to compromise with the outgroup (Palestinians). It is hypothesized that results from this experiment will show that a moralistic frame incurs a backlash among other ingroup members, making them less likely to express or approve criticism and less willing to compromise with the outgroup, whereas the group-interested frame increases such willingness.", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "Approximately 100-200 units", "extra": []}, "id": "20160717AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "Most of the quantities of interest fall into three groups in this study: (1) willingness to engage in ingroup criticism, (2) approval of criticism coming from other ingroup members, and (3) willingness to compromise with the outgroup (Palestinians).\n\n1.

In order to answer these questions, I propose three theoretical mechanism through which the UN promotes local level peace in this regard. First, the UN acts as an enforcer of local level peace, punishing and deterring individuals that use violence to resolve a dispute. Second, the UN presence increases the legitimacy of formal, domestic institutions for resolving disputes. Third, the UN diffuses a norm against violence, de-legitimizing violence as a tool for solving disputes in the process.

This means that the four attributes that define this type of party organization are observable at the FA at the time of our fieldwork.\n\nHypothesis 4 (causal inference - reproduction): The FA did not oligarchize because of the political role granted to grassroots activists; they have always had representatives in the decision-making levels of the organization. This was granted to a level that ensured their ability to block changes in the organization\u00b4s statutes, engendering a lock-in effect. As a result (intermediate outcome), the FA combines organizers (base activists) and mobilizers (leaders from factions) within its structure (Han 2014). \n\nHypothesis 5 (descriptive inference grassroots organization): The bases did not oligarchize. They still have an open democratic structure. \n\nHypothesis 6 (causal inference of the non oligarchization of the bases): The bases do not oligarchize because they maintain a non-professional structure and they are not the first step in a political career to elective office; they are also not necessary to obtain a designated position in government.\n\nHypothesis 7 (result, the FA in opposition and in government): The mass party organization restricts the decisions of the party elite while in opposition and in government: it limits the party leaders\u00b4 incentives to moderate.\n\nSURVEY EXPERIMENT: The reduction of the political role assigned to the bases negatively impacts the activists\u00b4 level of engagement.

For example, if an actor is less certain about what is and what is not sensitive, we should expect them to self-censor to a greater extent than someone who is more certain about where the red lines are. Interestingly, this suggests that those who are better informed about censorship boundaries, say those with close links to the government, will be less constrained by self-censorship. This logic helps explain why in prominent autocracies like China and Russia, media organizations with close links to the state often publish and host more critical content than independent organizations. \n\nIn this study, we aim to measure self-censorship in two ways. First, we plan to survey respondents in authoritarian countries and ask them whether or not they believe examples of provided content would or would not be censored, as well as how confident they are of their assessment.

Current works have used observational studies to empirically test this claim but the authors admit a lack of appropriate observable measures for electoral uncertainty.

Of these, the study of how bureaucrats use performance information can be characterized as underexplored.\n\nThe desire to assess and understand the performance of public organizations means that today, more than at any point in history, many public managers live and work in a world filled with performance metrics and statistics about their organization. Despite this fact, a prominent scholar recently commented that \u201cwe know little about the basic tendency of individuals to incorporate and use performance information\u201d (Moynihan 2015). This gap has important practical and theoretical implications. Theoretically, we lack the information to know if our models of how public managers use performance information are accurate. This has implications for scholarship as well as teaching. Because of this, practically, any examples of best practices are largely anecdotal. If we are to develop our theory in this area and if we are to develop a rigorous, generalizable set of best practices for how public managers can use performance metrics then we need to better understand how they respond to this type of information.\n\nThis study seeks to explore competing assumptions about how bureaucrats use performance information.  On one hand, we might assume bureaucrats will use performance information in a way that is highly cognitive because performance management systems\u2014the programs that produce the type of performance information of interest to this study\u2014largely assume that users of this information are rational (i.e. cognitive) actors.  On the other hand, decades of research from the behavioral perspective suggests that individuals who use performance information may not use it in a way that matches the assumptions of performance management systems.  An increasing amount of evidence points to this being the case as well in the area of public administration.

This suggests that they are influenced not only by their immediate kinship networks (Sircar, 2015), but also by local actors beyond their kinship network. In rural India, a whole array of local characters plays such a role during electoral campaigns (Bj\u00f6rkman, 2014; Chauchard, 2016), as candidates and party networks rely on a variety of locally known, influential citizens to draw crowds to meetings, canvass and eventually attempt to convince voters. These individuals also play a role between elections, as they serve as intermediaries between elected officials and citizens, assisting citizens access the state and assisting elected officials with the mobilization of citizens and with the implementation of their policies.\nWhile they have sometimes been clubbed under one label, as \"brokers\" or \"intermediaries\", these local-level actors are astonishingly diverse. The literatures on distributive politics, \"claim-making\" and electoral campaigns in India (Manor, 2000; Krishna 2002; Auerbach, 2013; Dunning and Nilekani, 2013; Bussell, 2014; Bj\u00f6rkman, 2014; Kruks-Wisner, 2015; Chauchard, 2016) suggest that these actors may be elected or unelected, partisan or non-partisan, that they may belong to a variety of caste and ethnic groups, and that they may be more or less proximate to voters on a number of different dimensions.\nAs a result of this diversity, we still know very little about the identity, the role and the relative ability of these crucial actors. In light of this lack of data, and in light of the diversity of these individuals, this project has several objectives, which we will likely explore in several different papers (or more likely, in several different chapters of a book manuscript):\n\n1.

Relatedly, determine which villagers does each type of local influencers know best and which villagers does each type of influencer have information on.\n(b) Make inferences as to which villagers each of these local actors are willing to help and assist in their interactions with the state.\n\n3. Finally and most importantly, determine which of these influencers are better at mobilizing and persuading citizens. That is, determine which individual-level characteristics of these local \"influencers\" makes them the most effective at mobilizing and persuading citizens, and in reverse, from which kinds of influencers voters are most likely to take their cues at the local level (This also allows us to\ndetermine the kinds of voters that different subtypes of influencers are likely to be able to mobilize and/or persuade).\n\nThe attached PAP details our research strategy to make inferences on all of these questions.\n\nThe \"hypotheses\" section below outlines specific hypotheses relevant to the more causal and quantitative parts of the project, i.e. points 2a, 2b and 3 above.", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": 176.0, "extra": []}, "id": "20160803AB", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "Z00", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "See PAP", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Influence in Rural India: An Experimental Approach", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": 42535.0, "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "STUDY00029571", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Simon Chauchard, Neelanjan Sircar", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Sunai ", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "See PAP", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": 42736.0, "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "India", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Registration prior to researcher access to outcome data", "extra": []}, "timestamp": "08/03/2016 - 19:51"}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": 42592.0, "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "The goal of this survey experiment is to supplement the findings of a field experiment (EGAP registry ID 20151012AA) that I conducted in the fall of 2015.

To this end, we adapt and extend Hainmueller et al.\u2019s (2014) conjoint design for stated-preference experiments. Respondents are presented with pairs of choice objects, created by choosing among a number of pre-set \u201clevels\u201d for each of several attributes.

Respondents vote on six pairs of candidates. \n\nHainmueller et al. (2014) hypothesize that conjoint designs are relatively insusceptible to social desirability bias, because the choice objects usually differ from one another on many dimensions that are not socially sensitive. A respondent who actually prefers profile A to profile B on racial grounds can therefore choose A without necessarily revealing her racial/ethnic preference. \n\nIn typical conjoint designs, attribute levels are independently randomized.

A large literature in comparative politics has documented informal leaders in these spaces, who emerge to demand development and fight eviction for residents, and encourage support and turnout for political parties. Situated between residents and the larger political currents of the city, informal slum leaders intimately structure local distributive politics in developing cities. Yet we know little about how these intermediary actors function, particularly which local demands they are most responsive to. What are the determinants of broker responsiveness to clients? \nExisting literature on Asian and African politics anticipates that slum leaders will privilege co-partisan and especially co-ethnic residents, whose reciprocity they can most easily monitor. Yet we argue such monitoring is challenging within India\u2019s densely populated and ethnically diverse slums. Instead of focusing purely on serving co-ethnics, we argue that brokers prioritize requests whose fulfillment will maximize their local reputations. In particular, we expect them to prove most responsive to residents who are most locally needy, and those who enjoy social network centrality within the slum. We test these expectations through a conjoint survey experiment, administered to a representative sample of 629 slum leaders across 110 slums in two Indian cities.\nIn the conjoint experiment, two fictitious residents were presented to slum leaders. Slum leaders were asked to choose the resident they prefer to help in obtaining a good or service. The attributes of the fictitious residents\u2014their caste, religion, region of origin, occupation, partisan preference, and time in the slum\u2014were randomly assigned, affording the co-investigators leverage over identifying the causal effects of each of the attributes. Importantly, our experimental design allows us to assess the relative importance of these attributes in shaping broker responsiveness. \nIn a separate experiment embedded on the same survey, we also sought to capture preferences for who moves into the slum\u2014what types of people do slum leaders prefer as residents? This allows us to directly compare preferences for clients versus everyday residents. We administered a conjoint experiment to slum leaders in which they were asked which of two fictitious individuals they would prefer as neighbors. The same attributes described above were randomly assigned to the two individuals. \n", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": 629.0, "extra": []}, "id": "20160813AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "The conjoint experiment was designed to assess the relative importance of certain key client traits in shaping broker responsiveness: co-ethnicity, co-partisanship, client material status, and client network centrality.\nExisting literature provides the theoretical expectations for the first two traits. Specifically, existing literature expects brokers to privilege co-ethnic and co-partisan clients. These expectations are formalized in the following two hypotheses: \n\nH1: Ethnicity: Co-ethnic residents (in our setting defined along the lines of jati (caste), religion, and region of origin) are preferred to non-co-ethnic residents.\nH2: Partisanship: Co-partisan residents are preferred to non-co-partisan residents. \n\nAdditionally, both co-investigators have conducted extensive qualitative fieldwork among the urban poor in India. Based on this fieldwork, we derived additional hypotheses of client characteristics likely to inform broker responsiveness. In particular, we theorize that brokers seek to cultivate locally positive reputations in order to build a following, and this incentivizes them to privilege particular types of residents. Specifically, we argue that brokers will privilege residents who are seen as locally needy as well as those who are socially embedded within the slum settlement. Helping such residents is most likely to generate and spread positive reputations of the brokers within their settlement. We measure these expectations in two ways: \n\nH3: Need: Residents in low-status jobs are preferred to residents in high-status jobs.\n\nH4: Centrality: \nH4a: Residents whose occupations endow them with social network centrality are preferred to those whose occupations do not. \n\nH4b: Residents who have resided in the settlement for a number of years will be preferred to those who are relatively new arrivals.  \n\nFinally, our argument anticipates a difference in the relative salience of these attributes. Formally, we hypothesize (H5) that the measures of network centrality and need will prove relatively more important than co-ethnicity and co-partisanship. The expectation of targeting co-ethnics and co-partisans arises out of theories of clientelism privileging the importance of monitoring client reciprocity. Yet such monitoring is difficult in densely populated slums, not to mention a country like India with a robust secret ballot. Further the ethnic and political heterogeneity of these settlements compel brokers to seek diverse coalitions of support. For these reasons, we anticipate brokers to prioritize client need and network centrality over co-ethnicity (especially based on narrow ethnic categories such as caste). \nFinally our neighbor experiment facilitates two kinds of comparisons. First, it allows us to examine the determinants of broker preferences along two dimensions: who to help within the settlement vs. who to let into the settlement to begin with. Our hypotheses H1-H4 remain the same for this experiment, but we expect the point estimates for co-ethnicity in the neighbor experiment, along the three dimensions specified above, to increase relative to those estimated from the client experiment.\nWe also compare the results of the neighbor experiment with a similar experiment conducted among slum residents in 2015. Here we expect that slum leaders are likely to place greater emphasis on shared partisanship, and lower emphasis on shared ethnicity than slum residents. We also expect that while slum residents prefer neighbors of higher occupational and educational status, slum leaders prefer the opposite (as lower status entrants are more likely to seek help and be cultivable as clients). \n", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Who do Slum Leaders Serve?

For example, men may receive systematically more beneficial outcomes from the informal justice system than women.\n\nThis study seeks to measure the effectiveness of a novel project implemented in Papua New Guinea by the New Zealand and Bougainville Police Services that seeks to overcome the challenges of policing in weak state environments, called the Community Auxiliary Police (CAP). The CAP project transfers the state\u2019s constitutional police powers to carefully selected community members in villages located in remote parts of the country, and trains those officers in investigative techniques and legal norms, particularly surrounding gender-based violence. CAP officers are unarmed but do have powers of arrest, detention and investigation in the communities that they come from.\n\nIn partnership with the Bougainville and New Zealand Police, researchers are conducting the first randomized evaluation to study the impact of the Community Auxiliary Police program on crime, norms and citizens\u2019 relationship to the state. \n\n", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": 1600.0, "extra": []}, "id": "20160820AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "D78, F68", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "The main hypotheses on household outcomes state that: \n- having a CAP hired in one's village will decrease the probability that one falls victim to assault or theft\n- having a CAP hired in one's village will increase subjective perceptions of safety and security\n- having a CAP hired in one's village will increase trust in the police in terms of procedural justice \n- having a CAP hired in one's village will increase alignment with state norms related to justice and to gender \n- having a CAP hired in one's village will decrease the importance and legitimacy of traditional forms of justice\n\nThe main hypotheses on candidate outcomes state that:\n- being hired as a CAP may increase or decrease one's propensity for corruption\n- being hired as a CAP may increase or decrease one's sense of impunity to local punishment\n- being hired as a CAP will increase alignment with state norms on gender and justice", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Randomized Impact Evaluation of the Community Auxiliary Police, Bougainville, Papua New Guinea", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": 42578.0, "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "AAAQ2155", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Jasper Jack Cooper", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "New Zealand Police and Bougainville Police Service", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "Randomization inference (RI) and Bayesian inference (BI) methods are described at length in the PAP.

Prior scholarship has demonstrated that merely informing parents about the quality of their children's education and their rights to take action has, at best, only mixed effects on parental efforts. We hypothesize that it may be possible to boost efficacy and, in turn, active citizenship through a short-term, intensive intervention that we call Validated Participation. This meeting-based intervention, to be delivered in a series of school communities, affords parents a unique opportunity to discuss evidence, share inferences and arguments, make decisions, and to have those activities validated by an authority figure. \n\nIn this Phase 1 (pilot) field experiment in Tanzania, we deliver this intervention alongside Information about how to become more involved in their child's learning.

We will observe substantial increases in parents' education and general efficacy about how they can have a positive impact at home and at school, but only among parents assigned to VP.\n3. We believe it will be easier to change parents' beliefs than it will to concretely affect behavior in the short-term. Nonetheless, we believe it is likely that in both IO and VP, we will observe increased parental monitoring and engagement at home and at school, with a larger effect evident in the VP arm.\n4. We expect to see some improvement in the parent-teacher relationship, particularly with parents being more inclined to voice a sense of responsibility for the child's education, but only in the VP arm.\n5. In turn, it is possible that we may see improved teacher attendance in the VP schools, but especially given the low sample size and the time it would take to change patterns, we believe it is unlikely that we will observe substantial change.\n6. While we hope that learning outcomes will improve and the gains to be greater in the VP arm than in the IO arm, we think it is unrealistic to expect substantial changes in just a few months in this small sample. The link from efficacy to action to changed school and home conditions to improved learning is a long one, and we may not see changes in this iteration of the study.\n7.

A compelling body of literature points to the increased ideological distance between the parties as the source of this increased gridlock (Krehbiel 1998). Constituents have responded negatively, generally awarding Congress an approval rating below 20% in recent years. \n\nInterestingly, existing literature has shown that voters punish representatives for ideologically extreme roll call behavior. How is it, then, that these extreme members retain their seats in Congress? Scholars have provided two possible explanations, including that these members accurately represent their districts' ideologies and that extreme members don't retain their seats. However, both of these explanations are left wanting - there continue to be extremists in Congress, and many of them continue to be reelected in spite of being more extreme than their districts. \n\nWe posit a third possibility: that extreme members of Congress disproportionately benefit from valence attributes, or non-policy characteristics. We present evidence that extreme members of Congress are generally regarded as both more competent and as having more integrity than non-extreme members of Congress. However, extreme members systematically perform lower levels of legislative activity and constituency service. As a result, it is necessary to conduct an experiment that tests whether there is something inherent to extremism; do constituents trust extreme representatives simply because they are extreme? It may be the case that extremism signals high policy knowledge or an ability to stand up to interest groups. The only way to undercover this mechanism is through an experiment.

In particular, each subject has the ability to influence an election between two candidates, A (the political machine) and B (the opposition). The subject can pay a small cost to declare support for candidate A or B by displaying a corresponding flag on her fictitious home. We induce political preferences for the two fictitious candidates using a standard methodology in experimental economics: a reward mechanism in which different electoral outcomes generate different monetary values. That is, we induce a stronger ideological affiliation with a candidate by increasing the monetary reward the citizen receives from that candidate\u2019s victory (regardless of whether she declares). In our experiment, subjects will be assigned randomly (without replacement) to one of seven partisan types -- that is, induced ideological preference for a candidate, ranging from a strong preference for candidate A to a strong preference for candidate B.

First, much of the literature on comparative politics assumes that the poor prefer direct redistributive transfers to the diffuse and often delayed gains from infrastructure investments.  But this assumption is rarely examined, and existing survey instruments, usually asking respondents a series of questions about their support for a given issue, provide limited leverage to understand public priorities.  This project therefore uses a new survey technique called Quadratic Voting (QV) that provides respondents a budget to spend across a group of survey questions and therefore leads them to consider both the intensity and direction of their preferences.  Using this technique, I test my hypothesis that low-income groups indeed prioritize redistributive spending, but they also care about urban transit projects that affect their everyday quality of life.  I also examine how the distance from a project and commuting patterns impact stated priorities. \n\nThe second set of hypotheses relate to how taxation affects support for infrastructure projects.  Mass transit projects, in particular, tend to be enormously expensive, and generate windfall gains for some nearby property owners and regular transit users, concentrated losses among those who have their land seized, and diffuse benefits for most others.  A major question is how to distribute these uneven costs in city space.  My hypotheses relate to how financial instruments can affect the distribution of support across property owners and renters, and those who live nearby and distant from mass transit projects.  In particular, I expect that value-capture mechanisms that levy special fees on nearby property owners have the potential to create a more even distribution of support for major infrastructure projects.  While they reduce support among those property owners who expect to see windfall gains, they boost support in the rest of the city.  Bogot\u00e1 has a long history of using value-capture mechanisms to fund infrastructure and thus represents an ideal case to test these hypotheses.

Or do they resist the facts when the evidence is politically uncongenial? A growing literature seeks to answer these questions, which have important implications for citizen competence and political accountability (e.g., Hochschild and Einstein 2015). \n\nOne set of studies finds that people are often highly resistant to unwelcome information. For instance, Nyhan and Reifler (2010) find that corrective information in mock news articles frequently fails to reduce salient misperceptions among ideologically vulnerable groups. Other studies that use relatively balanced formats have also found stiff resistance to uncongenial claims (Nyhan, Reifler, and Ubel 2013; Garrett, Nisbet, and Lynch 2013; Garrett and Weeks 2013). More notably, Nyhan and Reifler (2010) find in two of five analyses that exposure to corrective information can increase the prevalence of misperceptions among vulnerable groups compared to those who read an article with no correction - a \u201cbackfire effect.\u201d\n\nHowever, other studies find that fact-checks or other forms of corrective information are at least somewhat successful at reducing misperceptions, with subjects accepting the correction provided to them (e.g., Weeks 2015; Nyhan and Reifler N.d.; Wood and Porter N.d.).[fn]Complicating matters further, Nyhan et al. (2014) and Nyhan and Reifler (2015) find that corrections about vaccine side effects reduce misperceptions even among people with less favorable attitudes toward vaccines, but also reduce their self-reported intention to vaccinate themselves or their children in the future.[\\fn]  These studies, which may use less salient controversies and/or more one-sided stimuli, find that people - at least in some contexts or on some issues - are willing to update their beliefs. Most notably, Wood and Porter (2016) test for backfire effects across 32 issue areas and observe only one instance of backfire (the Iraq WMD item from Nyhan and Reifler 2010), but show that this result is sensitive to question wording. However, Wood and Porter do find widespread evidence of motivated reasoning - the effects of corrective information varied by respondent ideology for approximately 80% of the issues tested (i.e., correction effects were larger for ideologically agreeable factual corrections). In contrast, Nyhan and Reifler (N.d.), who largely test more obscure state-level fact-checks, find no evidence that respondents were more willing to update their beliefs in response to uncongenial fact-checks than for those that were favorable to their point of view.\n\nA third possibility is that people are willing to update their beliefs dispassionately, but interpret those facts in a belief-consistent manner. Using panel data from the Iraq War, Gaines et al. (2007) find that both Democrats and Republicans updated their beliefs as the facts changed, but that interpretations of the facts sharply diverged between the parties. In their telling, for instance, both groups recognized that WMD had not been found, but Democrats simply said that WMD did not exist, while Republicans explained that Saddam Hussein might have moved or  destroyed the weapons or hidden them successfully from U.S. forces.\n\nWe thus have three different accounts of how people\u2019s beliefs change (or not) in response to corrective information that we will test in the study described below. In the motivated resistance account, citizens strongly resist information that conflicts with their partisan or ideological commitments and may even double down on their misperceptions. By contrast, the belief updating account suggests that people generally accept new information and update their beliefs to be at least somewhat more accurate, though differences in responsiveness to corrective information based on prior attitudes may persist. Finally, the interpretations account proposes that citizens update their beliefs as new facts are presented to them but instead interpret those facts along partisan lines.\n\nHowever, the research described above neglects the role that elites can play in cultivating resistance to factual information. Research shows that elites wield disproportionate influence over mass attitudes (e.g., Zaller 1992; Lenz 2012). Can they cultivate public resistance to unwelcome information from neutral sources as well? Such a possibility would provide an alternate account for why corrections are often seemingly ineffective at changing persistent misperceptions over controversial issues. We will therefore also consider whether elite messages increase motivated resistance to unwelcome factual information and/or belief-consistent interpretations of that information. Moreover, we stage our experiment at the peak of the presidential election, when partisan commitments are strongest and the influence of partisan leaders is therefore likely to be strongest.\n\nFinally, this study will consider potential differences in respondent behavior across online panels that might affect the conclusions of studies of misperceptions. Though studies have found that Mechanical Turk workers provide valid survey data (e.g., Berinsky, Huber, and Lenz 2012) and that the relationships between workers\u2019 characteristics and their attitudinal outcomes closely reflects those observed in more expensive traditional surveys (Druckman et al. 2016), concerns continue about social desirability bias in surveys conducted by interviewers who pay and evaluate respondents (e.g., Clifford and Jerit 2015). This concern may be particularly severe for studies of misperceptions. Respondents may be inclined to endorse corrective information provided during a study on Mechanical Turk to demonstrate that they read the stimuli assigned to them and/or were paying attention. This study will therefore consider whether the results differ between Mechanical Turk and the online panels such as SSI from which Morning Consult draws its respondents, providing vital guidance to future researchers seeking to exploit Mechanical Turk to measure factual receptivity.", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "~1200 (Morning Consult), ~3000 (Mechanical Turk)", "extra": []}, "id": "20161011AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "In this study, we will randomly assign respondents to one of five conditions. In a control condition, respondents will read a placebo article intended to provide a baseline for estimating experimental effects. Participants in the treatment conditions will instead read a version of a mock news article featuring a real factual misstatement by Donald Trump about crime rates from the current (2016) presidential campaign. In one treatment condition, participants will read an article that omits corrective information, allowing us to test the effect of exposure to misleading information alone. Others will be randomly assigned to a second treatment condition in which they read a version of the article that includes neutral corrective information from the FBI, allowing us to test its effects versus a no-correction version of the article as well as the control condition. Finally, two other treatment conditions will test whether elite political actors can cultivate resistance to factual information by randomizing whether the correction is followed by a statement by a partisan elite disparaging the validity of the information (the third treatment condition) or statements by the elite both disparaging the validity of the information and attributing a political motive to the source of the information (the fourth treatment condition, which uses the Hillary Clinton email scandal to question the motives of the FBI).\n\nHypotheses:\n\nTo recap, we seek to evaluate three theoretical approaches to understanding how voters respond to incongruent factual information, using support for Trump as the relevant prior attitude that affects respondents\u2019 propensity to engage in directionally motivated reasoning:\n\nH1: Motivated resistance\nUnder H1, respondents are expected to resist unwelcome facts about controversial issues through mechanisms such as counterargument and source derogation. As a result, people exposed to attitude-inconsistent corrective information will not come to hold more accurate views. In some cases, their views could even become more inaccurate. \n\nIf this hypothesis is correct, the correction provided in our study will not make Trump supporters more likely to correctly answer that crime has decreased over the past ten years. It could even make them more likely to say crime has increased over the previous ten years. Trump supporters who are exposed to corrective information should also be more likely to question the accuracy of crime statistics as well as the accuracy and fairness of the article (we intend to test the effect of treatments on these potential mechanisms directly).\n\nMotivated resistance to unwelcome corrective information is likely to become more severe when elites attack the source of the information or endorse a conspiracy theory about its origins. We therefore expect higher levels of misperceptions and more counterargument and source derogation when the accuracy of the information is questioned and its source is attacked.\n\n(H1 does not offer clear expectations about how people interpret their factual beliefs.)\n\nH2: Differential acceptance\nUnder H2, respondents are expected to accept unwelcome facts and update their beliefs to become more accurate, though the extent to which they update their beliefs may vary based on their prior attitude. If this hypothesis is correct, we would expect corrective information to generally reduce misperceptions, though acceptance of such information may vary by Trump support. We would similarly not expect corrective information to increase source derogation and counterargument under H3. However, when elites cultivate resistance to corrective information, it may undermine this pattern, especially among those respondents for whom rejecting the corrective information is politically congenial. \n\n(H2 does not offer clear expectations about how people interpret their factual beliefs.)\n\nH3: Attitude-consistent interpretation\nUnder H3, respondents are expected to accept unwelcome facts, but to instead adapt their interpretation of these facts to make them more consistent with their political commitments. If this hypothesis is correct, we would expect corrective information to decrease misperceptions but to observe increases in the extent to which people adopt politically congenial interpretations of the factual beliefs that they hold. We would not expect corrective information to increase source derogation and counterargument.\n\n(H3 does not offer clear expectations about how people will respond to elite arguments against corrective information.)\n\nWe will also examine the following research questions where we have weaker priors:\n\nRQ1. Are respondents on Mechanical Turk more willing to update their beliefs in response to corrective information than respondents recruited from other online panels? \nRQ2. Does exposure to corrective information about crime affect the salience of the issue or change people\u2019s policy views on the issue?\nRQ3. Does exposure to corrective information about crime affect evaluations of the incumbent president (Obama), the candidate whose statement is questioned (Trump), or the candidate who is invoked in an elite attack on the correction (Clinton)?\n", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Factual Corrections During A Presidential Election", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "Dartmouth 8/24/16, Exeter 9/6/16, GW 9/21/16, OSU 9/29/16", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "GW #081618, Dartmouth STUDY00029776, Exeter (no number), OSU #2016B0313", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Brendan Nyhan, Ethan Porter, Jason Reifler, Thomas J.

The non-Mechanical Turk survey will be administered by Morning Consult, an online polling firm that works with academics, elected officials and media organizations. The Morning Consult sample, which is drawn from a number of online survey panel providers such as SSI and Research Now, will include up to 2,000 respondents (sample size TBD - depends on the number of Morning Consult respondents who consent to participate). \n\nRandomization approach:\n\nThe study begins with a series of standard demographic questions (some of these will be omitted on Morning Consult if they are asked earlier in the survey), including respondent partisanship, ideology, candidate preference, political knowledge, and the importance of the issue of crime. Participants will then read one randomly assigned news article about either the ongoing presidential campaign or a beauty pageant (described further below). Randomized assignment to condition occurs via a randomizer within the Qualtrics survey environment. After randomization and exposure to treatment, subjects will be asked to share their perspective on the crime rate in the United States. Finally, participants will be informed that the news article was not real and that this research has no affiliation with any electoral candidate or political party and has received no financial support from any candidate or party. The complete text of both surveys is appended to this document. \n\nThe experimental design used in the study is based on real news articles from July 2016 covering the Republican National Convention and Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. In his speech accepting the Republicans Party's nomination for president, Trump described an America ridden by increasing crime. His depictions did not appear to accord with the F.B.I. crime data, which tell a story of long-term secular decline. Paul Manafort, Trump's campaign chairman at the time, was pressed about this discrepancy. Manafort responded by questioning the validity of the F.B.I. statistics and suggesting that the F.B.I. could not be trusted given their decision not to indict Hillary Clinton in her email scandal. \n\nWe constructed our five experimental conditions, which are described below, to capture these events. All treatment articles are approximately the same length. Respondents were randomly assigned with equal probability to one of the five conditions.\n\nCondition Crime Claim FBI Stats Correction Manafort Rejection HRC Conspiracy\nPlacebo No No No No\nTrump Yes No No No\nTrump Correction Yes Yes No No\nTrump Correction/ Source Rejection Yes Yes Yes No\nTrump Correction/ Source/Conspiracy Yes Yes Yes Yes\n\n\u25cf Subjects in the Placebo condition are shown an article about birdwatching. \n\u25cf Subjects in the Trump condition are shown a news article on his claims about crime\n\u25cf Subjects in the Trump Correction condition are shown a news article summarizing his claims about crime and a correction based on F.B.I. statistics.\n\u25cf Subjects in the Trump Correction/Source Rejection are shown a news article summarizing his claims about crime, a correction based on F.B.I. statistics, and a quotation from Manafort rejecting the F.B.I. statistics. \n\u25cf Subjects in Trump Correction/Source/Conspiracy are shown a news article summarizing his claims about crime, a correction based on F.B.I. statistics, a quotation from Manafort rejecting the F.B.I. statistics, and Manafort's contention that the F.B.I. was not to be trusted because of their failure to indict Clinton. \n\nAfter reading their assigned article, subjects will answer two questions measuring respondents\u2019 recall of its content. They will then be asked if crime today is higher or lower than it was ten years ago and then asked if it somewhat or a lot higher/lower. Respondents will then be asked why the change they believe took place occurred. If subjects affirm that crime has decreased, they will be asked to choose among potential explanations for this decline; likewise, if subjects assert that crime has increased, they will also be asked to choose among explanations. In each case, we present subjects with several interpretations of the proposed change that will vary in how congenial they will be to respondents. These questions provide subjects a chance to interpret the facts as they understand them.\n\nSpecifically, we expect that for respondents who believe that crime has gone down, the viewpoint-consistent interpretation for conservatives will be \u201cTougher policing and longer prison sentences,\u201d while the liberal choice will be \u201cThe improved economy and reduced unemployment.\u201d For those who believe that crime has gone up, the viewpoint-consistent conservative interpretation will be \u201cThe decline in morals and values\u201d and the liberal interpretation will be \u201cIncreased economic inequality and helplessness.\u201d Respondents are later asked to provide an additional post-treatment measure of the importance of crime, another potential way to interpret the study in a belief-consistent manner.\n\nSubjects will also be asked to evaluate the accuracy of federal crime statistics, the extent to which the article they read was accurate in its reporting of federal crime statistics, and whether they believe the article they read is biased or unfair. All of these represent potential mechanisms of counterargument for respondents who are resistant to the corrective information that was presented to them.\n\nFinally, respondents will be asked to provide their policy opinions on a series of issues including those related to crime and criminal justice and to evaluate a series of politicians including Barack Obama and Donald Trump.\n\nOutcome measures\n\nPrimary outcome measures: Factual beliefs and interpretations\n\nOur primary factual belief outcome measures come from the following questions:\n\nWe now would like to ask you some factual political questions.Would you say that, compared to ten years ago, the violent crime rate has gone up, stayed about the same, or gone down?\n- Gone up \n- Stayed about the same \n- Gone down\n \nIf \u201cGone up\u201d is selected\nCompared to ten years ago, has the violent crime rate gone up a lot or only somewhat?\n-Gone up a lot\n-Gone up somewhat\n \nIf \u201cGone down\u201d is Selected\nCompared to ten years ago, has the violent crime rate gone down a lot or only somewhat?\n-Gone down a lot\n-Gone down somewhat\n\nFrom these, we construct two outcome variables coded as follows where higher values indicate greater misperceptions:\n\nScale:              Binary:\nGone down a lot (1)    Gone down/Stayed the same (0)\nGone down somewhat (2)   Gone up (1)\nStayed about the same (3)\nGone up somewhat (4)\nGone up a lot (5)\nTo assess the interpretation hypothesis, we ask these questions.\n\nIf \u201cGone down\u201d is selected:\nWhat would you say is the main reason violent crime has gone down?\n-Tougher policing and longer prison sentences\n-The improved economy and reduced unemployment\n-Some other reason\n-Don't know\n \nIf \u201cGone up\u201d is selected:\nWhat would you say is the main reason violent crime has gone up?\n-The decline in morals and values\n-Increased economic inequality and helplessness\n-Some other reason\n-Don't know\n\nThese questions are combined into a single variable coded as follows that distinguishes liberal and conservative interpretations of factual beliefs:\n\n-Crime up/inequality or Crime down/unemployment (-1)\n-Crime up/down for some other reason/don\u2019t know or crime unchanged (0)\n-Crime up/moral decline or Down/tougher policing (1)\n\nSecondary outcome measures: Source derogation, counterargument, and politician/candidate evaluation \n\nHigher values indicate greater source derogation and counterargument for these variables: \n\nIn your view, how accurate are federal crime statistics?\n- Extremely accurate (1)\n-Somewhat accurate (2)\n-Not very accurate (3)\n- Not at all accurate (4)\n \nIn your view, how accurate was the article you read in reporting federal crime statistics?\n-Extremely accurate (1)\n-Somewhat accurate (2)\n-Not very accurate (3)\n-Not at all accurate (4)\n\n(Due to an error in the survey instrument, this question was answered by respondents in the placebo condition. We may therefore omit this group from our analyses.)\n\nIn your opinion, how fair was the article you read?\n- Extremely fair (1)\n-Somewhat fair (2)\n-Not very fair (3)\n-Not at all fair (4)\n \nWe will construct a bias scale from the following questions:\n\nWould you say the article you read was biased or not biased?\n-Yes, biased \n-No, not biased\n \nIf \u201cYes, biased\u201d Is Selected\nWould you say the article had a liberal bias, a conservative bias, or some other bias?\n-Liberal \n-Conservative \n-Other \n\nIf \u201cYes, biased\u201d Is Selected\nWould you say the article was extremely biased, somewhat biased, or slightly biased?\n-Extremely biased \n-Somewhat biased \n-Slightly biased \n\nFrom these three questions about bias, we will construct a single outcome measure measuring the direction and extent of perceived bias.\n\nExtremely biased liberal (-3)\nSomewhat biased liberal (-2)\nSlightly biased liberal (-1)\nNot biased/biased-other (0)\nSlightly biased conservative (1)\nSomewhat biased conservative (2)\nExtremely biased conservative (3)\n\nFinally, we will evaluate evaluations of candidates and politicians using the following questions.\n\nDo you approve or disapprove of how Barack Obama is handling his job as president?\n-Strongly approve (5)\n-Somewhat approve (4)\n-Neither approve nor disapprove (3)\n-Somewhat disapprove (2)\n-Strongly disapprove (1)\n\nWe ask the question \u201cDo you feel favorable or unfavorable toward each of these individuals?\u201d about Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, John Kasich, and George W. Bush. Each is coded as follows:\n-Very favorable (5)\n-Somewhat favorable (4)\n-Neither favorable nor unfavorable (3)\n-Somewhat unfavorable (2)\n-Very unfavorable (1)\n\nStatistical analyses:\n\nAll models will be estimated using OLS with robust standard errors. (Regression results for binary dependent variables will be verified for robustness using probit. Regression results for  individual ordered dependent variables will be verified for robustness using ordered probit. Regression results for ordered scales constructed from multinomial data will be verified for robustness using multinomial logit or multinomial probit.) \n\nData from the Morning Consult and Mechanical Turk will be reported and analyzed separately. \n\nEach model will be estimated using this specification (no other covariates will be included): \n\nDVi,j = b0,j+b1,jTrump supporti + b2,jTrump messagei + b3,jTrump correctioni + b4,jTrump correction/source rejectioni + b5,jTrump correction/source/conspiracyi + b6,jTrump supporti*Trump messagei + b7,jTrump supporti*Trump correctioni + b8,jTrump supporti*Trump correction/source rejectioni + b9,jTrump supporti*Trump correction/source/conspiracyi + e \n\nDue to the relatively small number of voters who decline to support Trump or Clinton in our binary vote choice question and the unclear nature of their directional preferences, we plan to omit this group from our main estimates (but will report models that include them and includes appropriate interactions with the treatment conditions in an appendix). The omitted category for the Trump support indicator variable is thus Clinton support.\n\nWe will compute and report appropriate auxiliary quantities as described below, including the marginal effect of each treatment for the subgroup in question as well as well as the difference in marginal effects between subgroups. Unless otherwise specified, all tests will consider the effects of the treatments with respect to the uncorrected condition in which respondents are only exposed to Trump\u2019s message. In the models above, however, the reference category is the placebo condition (though we may estimate identical models that omit the placebo condition for expositional clarity and report these models in an appendix). We will also compute and report estimates with respect to the placebo condition, but consider such findings to be secondary outcome measures rather than direct tests of our hypotheses. (The reason is that the effect of the corrective conditions compared to the placebo is double-barrelled - subjects have been exposed to Trump\u2019s message and a correction.)\n\nThese models will be estimated for the outcome variables defined above: factual beliefs about changes in crime (full scale and binary); interpretations of changes in crime; source derogation and counterargument (crime statistics, accuracy of reporting about crime statistics, fairness, and bias); importance of crime and policy preferences (harshness and spending); and politician evaluation (Obama approval and favorability of Obama, Clinton, and Trump).\n\nH1: Motivated resistance \n\nTo evaluate H1, we will test whether the marginal effect of exposure to the correction conditions on misperceptions about changes in crime is null or positive for Trump supporters and whether the difference in treatment effects is significant versus Clinton supporters. As noted above, these marginal effects will be calculated with respect to the Trump message condition but we will also consider effects with respect to the placebo condition. We will also test directly whether the marginal effect of the elite resistance messages on misperceptions is greater than the effect of the neutral correction condition for Trump supporters and whether this effect differs from Clinton supporters. In addition, we will conduct all of the tests described above for the outcome measures measuring source derogation and counterargument.\n\nH2: Differential acceptance\n\nTo evaluate H2, we will test whether the marginal effect of exposure to the correction conditions on misperceptions about changes in crime is negative for Trump supporters and whether the difference in treatment effects is significant versus Clinton supporters. As noted above, these marginal effects will be calculated with respect to the Trump message condition but we will also consider effects with respect to the placebo condition. We will also test directly whether the marginal effect of the elite resistance messages on misperceptions is greater than the effect of the neutral correction condition for Trump supporters and whether this effect differs from Clinton supporters. \n\nH3: Attitude-consistent interpretation\n\nTo evaluate H3, we will test whether the marginal effect of exposure to the correction conditions on misperceptions about changes in crime is negative for both Clinton and Trump supporters. We will also test whether interpretations are more likely to be viewpoint-consistent among respondents who receive corrective information than among those who don\u2019t. (We plan to additionally consider descriptive statistics on crime interpretations for the subgroups of those who say crime has gone up or down and to consider how those interpretations differ between Clinton and Trump supporters.) As noted above, these marginal effects will be calculated with respect to the Trump message condition but we will also consider effects with respect to the placebo condition.\n\nRQ1. Differences in receptivity between Mechanical Turk and other online panel providers\n\nTo evaluate RQ1, we will compare the results obtained in evaluating H1, H2, and H3 in both the Mechanical Turk and Morning Consult samples per above, contrasting the treatment effects obtained across the two samples. We will also estimate pooled models for each model proposed to test H1, H2, and H3 that allow us to directly evaluate the null hypothesis of no difference in treatment effects between samples conditional on Trump support and sample of origin. Given likely differences between the Mechanical Turk and Morning Consult samples, we will estimate these models with indicators for gender, age groups, race, and political knowledge and report these results as well if they differ from those with covariates omitted. \n\nRQ2. Correction effects on issue salience and policy views\n\nTo evaluate RQ2, we will estimate the marginal effect of correction exposure on the importance of crime and respondent policy preferences on the issue for both Clinton and Trump supporters (we will also estimate whether the marginal effects differ between them).

Three short videos for each issue were produced and screened in rural Uganda, where these issues are prominent social concerns. The video vignettes were inserted in commercial breaks during films that were presented free of charge during a six-week film festival between July 30 and September 4, 2016. Our experimental sample contains 112 village clusters that were assigned to seven different treatment arms: 3 pairs of messages, 3 single-message treatments, and one pure control.

However, powerful governments often do engage in costly reactions in the face of terrorist threats, either in the form of concessions or, more often, expensive military engagements.

Existing strategic models of terrorism are incomplete due because they do not disaggregate the targets of terrorist violence and consider the psychological impact of specific attack strategies on civilian populations\u2019 perceptions of personal threat and risk. Specifically, this research contends that terrorism seeks to attrit or provoke powerful states through a purposeful strategic psychology that is designed to capitalize on psychological biases in risk assessment and divergent preferences between governments and their citizens. Namely, because the state\u2019s citizens care more about who was attacked rather than how difficult it was to attack them, governments are more likely to engage in stronger, costlier counter-terrorism efforts in the wake of attacks on soft, civilian targets than following attacks on harder military or governmental targets of the same magnitude.\n", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": 1000.0, "extra": []}, "id": "20161028AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "1) H1: Citizens will be more likely to overestimate the risk to their personal safety and report higher threat levels from terrorism after exposure to attacks against the mass public than after attacks against the government.\n2) H2: Citizens will be more likely to view terrorists as immoral and illegitimate following attacks on the mass public than following attacks against the government.\n3) H3: Citizens will be more likely to support costlier  government responses to terror attacks and be less supportive of maintaining status quo policies following attacks on the mass public than following attacks against the government.\n4) H4: Citizens will reduce their electoral support for political leaders that do not follow their policy preferences. \n5) H5: Citizens will express significantly higher levels of anger and fear, threat perceptions, negative moral judgments, and costly policy support in the mass public conditions, regardless of fortification type.

By contrast, examinations of political stereotypes in Asian countries are still far and few. \n\nAmong East Asian countries, Taiwan is well suitable for this topic of research. In China, Laos, and Vietnam, political competition occurs within the Communist party and there is no multiparty system. In Thailand and the Philippines, the party system is highly unstable and party names change frequently. In Mongolia, Japan, and South Korea, the party system is stable and polarized, but unlike Taiwanese politics, ethnicity is not politically salient within these three countries. Among countries where ethnicity is politically salient, distinguishing Chinese, Malays, and Indians in Malaysia and Singapore is much easier than differentiating Mainlander, Min-nan, and Hakka \u2013 the three largest ethnic groups - in Taiwan because major ethnic groups in Malaysia and Singapore have distinct physical features but in Taiwan people from different major ethnic groups look alike. Lastly, unlike Taiwanese, many Indonesians have no chance to meet all out-group members due to the wide and dispersed territory of Indonesia. \n\nIn sum, the stable party system helps Taiwanese establish partisan stereotypes based on long term observations; polarized and competitive party competition (Clark and Tan, 2012) motivates the average Taiwanese to use partisan stereotypes to judge a new friend\u2019s party identification and to avoid discussing politics with anyone who holds opposite political positions; and the non-descent-based ethnic cleavage further complicates Taiwanese partisan stereotypes.\n\nSince virtually every social cleavage that is politically salient in any Asian country exists in Taiwanese politics, studying partisan stereotypes in Taiwan can improve our understanding of how Asians view each other.

The subjects of this experiment will be Taiwanese citizens who grew up in Taiwan. In other words, all foreigners, Taiwanese who grew up in foreign countries, and Taiwanese under the age of 18 will be excluded.\n\nBefore subjects begin the online survey questionnaire, they will be explicitly informed that they are participating in an experiment and what they are asked to do during this experiment. The outcome variable will be the evaluated party identification of fictitious people whose profile will be showed to the subjects. Subjects will read one personal profile on the screen, and then they will be asked to use their intuition to choose this fictitious person\u2019s political party identification from the two major political parties, the DPP and the KMT.\n\nThere will be nine options for subjects to choose after they read the profile: (1) very strong KMT supporter, (2) somewhat strong KMT supporter, (3) not very strong KMT supporter, (4) neutral but lean to the KMT, (5) neutral, (6) neutral but lean to the DPP, (7) not very strong DPP supporter, (8) somewhat strong DPP supporter, and (9) very strong DPP supporter. The option (1) and (9) represent two most extreme point on the political spectrum, respectively, and Neutral (non-partisan) represents the midpoint. Given that this 9-point measurement of party identification does not violate the transitivity assumption in Taiwan (Shiao, 2009), my outcome variable is an ordinal scale.\n\nThe personal profile shown on the screen contains personal information which consists of five attributes including gender, age, language use, hometown, and occupation. Each of the attributes contains multiple values. In Taiwan, although one\u2019s ethnicity cannot be easily judged based on facial characteristics, language use offers a hint that this person may belong to which ethnic group. Even though more than 90% of Taiwanese speak Mandarin Chinese fluently (Chang and Lu, 2014), speaking standard Mandarin without any Taiwanese accent could imply that the speaker is a Mainlander as opposed to another ethnic group who speaks Hakka, Min-nan, or Mandarin Chinese with Taiwanese accent. Occupation tells people not only one\u2019s social class but also the possible position on social welfare policies or cross-strait policies. To maximize their own interests, Taiwanese who work in one of the three major public sectors (military, government, and public school) or is the owner/manager of enterprises invested in China are believed to be more KMT-supportive. The KMT\u2019s welfare policies and position on Taiwan-China relations especially favor them.\n\nFor each profile, I will use complete randomization to assign the values of each attribute. There are 480 unique profiles (combination of five attributes), and the frequency of appearance of each profile should be as similar as possible. After the subjects finish evaluating ten fictitious people\u2019s party identification, they will be asked to offer their personal information including gender, age, current occupation, education level, party identification, ethnic identity, and the number of people with whom they discuss about politics in daily life.\n\nThis experiment will be conducted through an online survey tool, Qualtrics. All subjects will use their own computers or laptops to do the online survey questionnaire, and the data will be electronically sent to me. The unit of the analysis is the evaluation of each profile, so each observation of data tells the information of the personal profile (the treatment) and the choice of party identification in that given evaluation (the outcome variable). \n\nSince the outcome variable is a 9-point ordinal scale of measurement level, it is feasible to employ the Ordinary Least Square method to examine the effect of treatments (e.g. the fictitious person\u2019s gender changes from male to female) on the outcome variable.\n", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "Taiwan", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Registration prior to assignment of treatment", "extra": []}, "timestamp": "11/01/2016 - 00:36"}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": 42663.0, "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "See PAP", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": 5300.0, "extra": []}, "id": "20161101AB", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "See PAP", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Determinants of refugee exclusion and its attenuation: the case of Syrian refugees to the U.S.", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "Exempt as of April 22, 2016", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "UCSD HRPP#160501", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Claire Adida, Adeline Lo, Melina Platas Izama", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "YouGov", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "See PAP", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "United States", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Registration prior to researcher access to outcome data", "extra": []}, "timestamp": "11/01/2016 - 13:08"}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": 42677.0, "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "This study investigates whether prospective students consider economic outcomes when choosing a future field of study.

However, the majority of energy consumers are not on the right energy tariff for them. A standard classical account of this would be that consumers have imperfect information over the quantities of interest required to compute what energy tariff is cheapest - e.g. they don't know how much energy costs or how much energy they use or at what time of day they use it (the latter is necessary if consumers are choosing between off-peak tariffs as well as just the conventional flat-rate tariffs). An alternative explanation that is gaining increasing momentum is that consumers lack the computational skills required to identify the cheapest tariff or at least that they will not devote the cognitive attention required to work it out. Some argue that these 'stylised\u2019 anecdotes about real-world consumer behaviour imply that we should alter or change the model that we use to explain consumer decision making and, moreover, that corrective policies should be introduced to prevent consumers from making these mistakes. However, as argued elsewhere (e.g. Allcott, 2011), we should be very careful before drawing such conclusions. First, the claim that the average consumer is not on the cheapest tariff for them is an inference based on the difference between the average available retail energy tariff and the cheapest available retail electricity tariff using modelled average energy consumption rather than from observed consumption and the consumers\u2019 actual tariff and it does not account for the possibility that consumers are maximising other components than price (e.g. quality of service, green energy etc).  Second, in the absence of smart meters which record actual energy use, it is highly likely that imperfect information is playing a major role in poor tariff selection; it is only if imperfect information cannot explain all of the poor selection that the classical economic model is false. Third, even if poor computational skills do cause people to choose a sub-optimal tariff, it is not necessarily true that a corrective policy (e.g. price regulation) would reduce the number of domestic consumers who are overpaying for their energy. Finally, just because some \u2018naive\u2019 consumers choose the wrong tariff, does not imply that the welfare costs of these mistakes are large; it is only if a large proportion of consumers fail to select the right tariff that energy companies will be able to \u2018charge what they want\u2019 because demand will be insufficiently elastic (Varian, 1980). \n\nTherefore, the central question around energy tariffs is whether there is sub-optimal decision making which purportedly corrective policies could correct \u2013 in other words, can energy consumers select the cheapest electricity tariff when given all the information required to make the right choice? If not, are there any definable characteristics for which consumers make better choices than others which regulators could use for targeting corrective policies? If not, is poor computation skills or unwillingness to exert cognitive effort more likely to account for this poor decision making?\n\nA survey administered to a panel of market research participants in the UK will be used to answer these questions. Although participants are unlikely to be representative of the UK population because the survey over represents people from London, there is no reason to think that the computational abilities and cognitive attention of Londoners is higher than anywhere else. Results will be weighted on observable characteristics such as age, region etc. \n\nParticipants will be asked to respond to three questions: (1) to identify whether they are an energy bill payer; (2) to respond to a vignette of a person who is looking to switch tariff; they will be required to select the cheapest of three tariffs for the person concerned having been given all the information required to compute this (the unit rate of electricity and standing charge on each of the tariffs in addition to the yearly electricity demand) \u2013 this counts as the \u2018low cognitive effort\u2019 scenario because there is relatively little information to process; (3) as before, to respond to a vignette of a person who is looking to switch tariff, except that, this time, one of the three tariffs includes an off-peak tariff; this means that the respondent must account for the timing of the person\u2019s electricity use in order to identify the cheapest tariff \u2013 this counts as the \u2018high cognitive effort\u2019 scenario because there is more information to process than in the previous vignette.

We will measure the perceived capacity of candidate\u2019s with a battery of questions asking voters to assess the following characteristics on a five-point scale: \n\u2022 How good manager do you think this candidate is?\n\u2022 How likely is it that this candidate is capable of ensuring order and discipline in the village?\n\u2022 How likely is it that this candidate can solve things in town?\n\nCandidate\u2019s positive personal characteristics. We will measure the perceived positive characteristics of the candidate with a battery of questions asking voters to assess the following characteristics on a five-point scale: \n\u2022 How likely is it that this candidate knows how to treat people?\n\u2022 How likely is it that this candidate helps poor people?\n\u2022 How likely is it that this candidate would help people in an emergency?\n\u2022 How likely is it that this candidate is a good Christian?\n\u2022 How likely is it that this candidate is a good family man?\n\nCandidate\u2019s corruption. We will measure the perceived corruption of candidate\u2019s with a battery of questions asking voters to assess the following characteristics on a five-point scale: \n\u2022 How honest do you think this candidate is?\n\u2022 How likely is it that this candidate is against corruption?\n\n\n\n\nc) Heterogeneous Effects\n\nPoverty. We will measure poverty using the respondents\u2019 self-reported income on a four-point scale. The measure will be reverse-coded. As a robustness check, we will also look at subjective poverty. \n\nEligibility for the workfare program. We will code someone as ineligible for the workfare program if they report their occupation as:\n\u2022 Employed\n\u2022 Retired\n\n\nd) Controls\n\nOur main specifications will include controls for gender, age, education, ethnicity, income, occupation, and partisan affiliation. \n", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": 43049.0, "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "Romania", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Registration prior to researcher analysis of outcome data", "extra": []}, "timestamp": "11/10/2016 - 18:45"}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": 42687.0, "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "The electrification of heat and transport is expected to place one of the biggest burdens on future electricity networks, especially at peak times such as weeknight evenings, when people return home from work. To mitigate this, governments are relying on domestic consumers to sign up to new types of smart-meter enabled electricity tariffs which will be designed to encourage them to use less electricity at peak times. For example, in the UK, the business case for smart meters relies on 20 percent of consumers switching to a time of use tariff (which charge people a higher rate for electricity consumed at peak times) by 2030. However, consumers rarely switch their energy tariff or supplier, despite the large savings involved. In Ireland, time of use tariffs will become mandatory. In the US, scholars and policymakers are advocating the use of an opt-out enrollment approach. However, consumers do not like being told what to do and these tariffs will not necessary benefit everyone. Moreover, evidence suggests that the effectiveness of opt-outs may originate from people's inattention to the default option. Whilst this may be a tolerable cost for boosting enrollment rates to pension schemes and organ donor registers (which are arguably in the majority of the public's interest), there is no point in enrolling people on tariffs without their knowledge as they are unlikely to adjust their electricity consumption patterns. Although third party automation of electrical demand (e.g home heating) could be used to avoid people from consuming at peak times, this still raises the question over how consent for such schemes would be obtained. One possibility is that suppliers will bundle these tariffs with third party control as part of the standard terms of conditions of the tariff. If people do not read terms and conditions, this presents a risk that people could sign up to automated control of their heating without their knowledge (raising ethical concerns, including over health and safety e.g. if elderly people sign up to automation without their knowledge and a supplier is able to reduce their heating demand temperatures). However, it is not known what proportion of people would fail to read the terms and conditions of such tariffs and therefore whether there is a genuine risk of this happening. An alternative approach would be for suppliers to actively prompt people to sign up to direct load control after they have switched to a time of use tariff \u2013 however, this may not result in a high enough number of sign ups to prevent people from losing money relative to a flat-rate tariff. \n\nThis project will run a field experiment to test low-cost methods of recruiting owners of plug-in electric vehicles and/or heat pumps (which are expected to be the dominant form of heating in 2030) to domestic demand-side response electricity tariffs. It will also test methods of obtaining informed consent for direct load control and will analyse whether these tariffs self-select consumers who are most likely to save money on the tariff (consumers with high consuming flexible electrical appliances) or whether such tariffs may also attract consumers who could be worse off on a time of use tariff than on a flat-rate tariff - and whether some methods are more likely to increase uptake amongst those who are likely to save money than others. The tariff was designed by a British energy supplier to be commercially viable in the current climate. \n\nThis study will be a randomised control trial in which two experiments will be run.\n\nExperiment 1\n\nThe first experiment will test two methods of boosting new customer registration rates \u2013 information provision and tailored information provision. Participants will be recruited through online advertisements and then randomly assigned to one of three versions of a website that was created especially for the trial in an A/B test style field experiment:\n\u2022 Control: existing company website, with multiple types of information but no pricing information (status quo)\n\u2022 Treatment group 1: price information with a price comparison \n\u2022 Treatment group 2: tailored price information\n\nExperiment 2\nIn addition, to test different methods of obtaining informed consent for additional home automation services, visitors will be randomly assigned within each of the three websites to one of two different ways of obtaining this consent: \n(1) third party direct load control of home heating is built into the standard terms and conditions of the tariff (bundled consent)\n(2) a text box informing them that the company could install a smart thermostat in their homes which the company will use to occasionally lower the temperature on their home heating during peak times help them save money on their energy bills which asks them to tick one of three boxes to indicate their preference: (i) yes they do want a smart thermostat which the energy company will remotely adjust at peak times or; (ii) they already have a smart thermostat but would like the company to remotely adjust the temperature set point at peak times or; (iii) they do not want the company to remotely adjust their heating (active choice). \n\nThis imagines a future in which most people have electric heating and smart thermostats to which suppliers, with consent, could connect to automatically. \n\nWe note that after participants assigned to the bundled condition switch, they are also asked to provide an active choice to whether or not they would like direct load control; this enables us to test whether they provided informed consent to DLC (as simply downloading the terms and conditions does not demonstrate that they read them and therefore were aware of the clause about direct load control). Therefore, the only difference between the active choice condition and the bundled condition is that the latter contains a clause that provides the supplier with permission to do direct load control whereas the terms and conditions in the former does not. \n\n", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": 12000.0, "extra": []}, "id": "20161112AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "Experiment 1\n(H1a): get a quote rates and switching rates will be higher amongst those who are more likely to benefit from the time of use tariff\n(H1b): get a quote rates and switching rates will be no higher amongst those who are more likely to benefit from the time of use tariff \n(H2) get a quote and switching rates will be higher amongst those who self-report having an Economy 7 tariff/meter\n(H3): Get a quote rates will be higher in the price comparison condition than the control condition\n(H4): Get a quote rates will be higher in the tailored condition than the control condition\n(H5): Get a quote rates will be higher in the tailored condition than the price comparison condition\n(H6): Get a quote rates will be higher in the tailored condition than either the control or price comparison conditions amongst the population of interest (heat pump and electric vehicle owners).\n\nExperiment 2\n(H1) the consent rate to direct load control of home heating will be higher in the bundled condition relative to the active choice condition\n(H2): informed consent rates to direct load control will be substantially higher in the active choice condition relative to the bundled condition", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Flex: a field experiment to investigate British consumer uptake to a \u2018smart\u2019 time of use tariff ", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "29/06/2016", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "UCL ethics project ID number 5701/002", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Moira Nicolson", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Researchers", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "Experiment 1\n\nHypotheses H1a-H1b will be tested by taking the total number of people who get a quote and dividing this by each of the key population sub-groups that indicate a greater likelihood of benefitting from the tariff: electric vehicle ownership, heat pump ownership, living in a house with over 4 bedrooms. \n\nHypotheses H1a-H1b will be tested by taking the total number of people who switch to the tariff and dividing it by each of the following sub-groups: electric vehicle ownership, heat pump ownership, living in a house with over 4 bedrooms, those living in a household with electric heating, tumble dryer, washing machine, dishwasher, washer-dryer respectively. \n\nH2 will be tested by taking the total number of people who get a quote or switch and dividing this by the number of people who self-report having an Economy 7 tariff/meter.

Each treatment dummy can either take on the value 0, indicating that the respondent was not in that group, or the value 1, indicating that the respondent was in that treatment group. \n\nIn equation 1, \u03b2_1 is the coefficient on \u3016T2\u3017_i, which measures the effect of being in the price comparison group rather than the control group and is our primary coefficient of interest for testing H3. \n\nIn equation 2 \u03b2_2 is the coefficient on \u3016T3\u3017_i, which measures the effect of being in the tailored group rather than the control group and is our primary coefficient of interest for testing H4. \n\nIn equation 3, \u03b2_3 is the coefficient on \u3016T3\u3017_i, which measures the effect of being in the tailored group rather than the price comparison group and is our primary coefficient of interest for testing H5. \n\nIn equation 4, \u03b2_6 is the coefficient on \u3016T3\u3017_i which measures the effect of being in the tailored group rather than the price comparison or control group amongst those for whom there are observations for the diagnostic indices (i.e. those who completed the surveys), whereas \u03b2_7 is the coefficient on the interaction term \u3016T3\u3017_i*\u3016\u03b4.index\u3017_i, which measures the effect of being in the tailored group rather than in the price comparison or control group amongst individuals who have a high value on the diagnostic index (e.g. self-report as having either an electric vehicle or a heat pump) compared to any individuals with a low value on the diagnostic index (i.e. did not report as having these appliances) and is therefore the coefficient of interest for testing H6. \n\n\u3016\u03b4.index\u3017_i in equation 4 is the dummy variable which indicates whether an individual has a high value on the diagnostic index (i.e. self-reported as having a heat pump or electric vehicle) compared to those who have a low value so \u03b2_8 is the coefficient on this variable which captures the effect of self-reporting to own one of these appliances on the outcome variable. As noted above, there are four diagnostic indices and each one will be used to estimate equation 4 respectively. \n\nIn equation 4, the variable J_i is the propensity score (the inverse probability of completing the survey and therefore having contributed to the diagnostic index). If the coefficient on the diagnostic index is significant then this is evidence that the tariff is self-selecting people who are more likely to benefit from the tariff, in line with classical expectations; if it is not significant, then there is no evidence for this, as consistent with a behavioural economic framework. If the coefficient on both the treatment and the interaction between treatment and the diagnostic index are significant, then diagnosis is important (i.e. tailoring works better on heat pump and EV owners) but the treatment also works regardless of diagnostic status. If the coefficient on the treatment dummy is not significant but the coefficient on the treatment by diagnostic index interaction is significant, then treatment is contingent upon proper diagnosis. If we have the reverse, then the treatment is more universally effective and diagnostics are not important. If neither is significant, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the treatment doesn\u2019t have an impact on anybody in the sample frame, diagnosed or not. \n\nAcross all equations, X_i is a vector of control variables, which includes a series of individual characteristic controls including whether they are a new or returning visitor [binary 1=yes; 0=no], the referring advert (fixed effects), the device the website was viewed on [binary 1=computer; 0=mobile/tablet] and the time the website was visited (fixed effects). u_i is the error term.\n\nMultiple comparisons corrections will be applied treating experiment 1 and experiment 2 as independent sets of tests. \n\nExperiment 2\n\nHypothesis 1 will be tested using a logistic regression using the following equation respectively:  \n(1) (Y_i )=\u03b1+\u03b2_1 \u3016T1\u3017_i+ X_i+ u_i\n\nIn the equation above, Y_i is the outcome measure; it is a binary variable taking the value of one (1) if the participant provides consent for direct load control and (0) otherwise as per Table 2. \u03b1 is the constant. \n\nThe treatment dummy T1 indicates whether individual i was assigned to the active choice condition, rather than the bundled condition. \n\n\u03b2_1 is the coefficient on \u3016T1\u3017_i, which measures the effect of being in the active choice condition rather than the bundled condition and is our primary coefficient of interest for testing H1.

In developing democracies, debates have the potential to provide valuable information to citizens on the character and policy positions of politicians. Despite the increasing prevalence of candidate debates, there is almost no causal evidence that assesses the impact of debates on voter preferences and voter attitudes towards democracy, especially outside of the US context.  Notable exceptions are Bidwell et al. (2016), who conduct a randomized experiment to measure the effect of parliamentary debates in Sierra Leone, and Platas Izama and Raffler (2016), who conduct an experiment around \"meet the candidate\" sessions, which are similar in structure to debates, in Uganda.  Our project complements and seeks to build upon these studies. \n\nThis study seeks to help  fill this gap. The project involves an opportunity to conduct a field experiment on the effects of parliamentary debates on voter preferences in the run-up to Ghana's general elections on 7th December 2016. The debates are being organized by the Ghana Center for Democratic Development (CDD), a leading civil society organization in Ghana. As we are primarily interested in understanding how and why debates impact voters' political preferences, and we aim to conduct in-depth qualitative research on the campaigns in our study areas, we are working in three constituencies, collecting a range of detailed descriptive and experimental data from a sample of roughly 2,000 citizens.  \n\nThe study has two broad objectives: 1) to study the impact of debates on voters' evaluations of candidates and their attitudes towards democracy; and  2) to study the impact of debates on the downstream performance of elected candidates during their terms in office. This pre-analysis plan focuses on the first goal.  This project is being funded by the International Growth Centre (IGC) and APSA Centennial Center.

Yet, when citizens are evaluating spending behavior and welfare benefits of government spending from different sources, their willingness to sanction and monitor may be driven by more than just a psychological aversion to loss and a desire to recover their taxed private revenue in the form of public goods provision. Accountability is a complex process, and in the presence of other political market failures -- such as repression, poor citizen access to information, or a lack of accountability mechanisms such as competitive elections -- taxation may increase citizens' desire for punishment without increasing observed sanctioning behavior in the real world. \n\nIn particular, barriers to the citizenry's ability to hold elected officials accountable may diminish the impact of individual-level psychological mechanisms. First, and perhaps most importantly, citizens must act in concert to exercise meaningful political power. Even in developed countries, the well-known coordination problems inherent in collective action often thwart attempts to organize for political change. In the developing world, the collective action problem is magnified by inadequate communications and transportation infrastructure, the high marginal cost of foregoing wages for the poor, and, in some cases, the very real possibility that the government responds to political expression with violence. These problems have the effect of driving down citizens' belief that others will act alongside them should they choose to do so, and makes the collective action dilemma especially problematic. \n\nOf course, solving the collective action problem is not by itself sufficient to monitor or punish elected officials. In authoritarian or quasi-authoritarian environments, politicians may have little incentive to respond to any attempts by citizens to hold officials accountable for corruption or incompetence. And in both authoritarian and democratic countries, the state may simply be incapable of instituting the kind of monitoring and punishment regime desired by citizens. For these reasons, citizens across sub-Saharan Africa tend to place extremely low probability on the success of any political action. With such low levels of external efficacy, it is therefore possible that we might observe few attempts to hold politicians more accountable for tax-based expenditures than other forms of expenditures even if taxation places them in a loss frame as the endowment effect suggests. These issues may be magnified for some non-tax revenue sources such as oil, which is opaque and generally has weaker accountability mechanisms than tax-based revenues. As such, any attempt to measure the effect of taxation on accountability must consider not only individual-level psychological mechanisms but also two critical quantities: whether citizens believe that others will act with them, and whether political action, conditional on occurring, will yield the desired effect. \n\nThere are thus two features of revenue expenditure and accountability beyond purely psychological mechanisms that may govern the frequency of political action to monitor and punish elected officials for spending behavior: %revenue-specific institutions that may make accountability more difficult for some sources than others; especially severe collective action problems facing citizens who wish to monitor or punish elected officials; and high level of pessimism with respect to the probability that an action will be successful if taken. \n\nEqually as important, these features may vary with respect to the source of revenue itself. While scholars often distinguish between tax- and non-tax revenues when studying accountability, relatively few studies have attempted to establish whether there are differences across non-tax revenues. Finally, political action does not occur in a vacuum, but in the context of norms and beliefs regarding the appropriate use of government funds. In particular, it is possible that public education campaigns could reduce the effect of revenue source on citizens' willingness to punish, especially if such campaigns stressed the responsibility of governments to spend funds on development and public goods. \n\nTo remedy this, we conducted lab-in-the-field experiment that follows in broad strokes the Martin (204) design, in which the author utilized laboratory experiments in Uganda to measure the existence of a loss aversion mechanism after citizens pay taxes. In the core games, one Citizen and one Leader play a modified ultimatum game, in which the Leader must allocate a group fund and the Citizen can choose whether to pay to punish this allocation; the source of the group fund is either a tax on the Citizen's ``wages\" or non-earned. We augment this initial design with additional arms designed to test the effect of collective action, uncertainty over whether punishment will occur, the source of the revenue from which the spending is being financed, and the degree of ownership the subject has over the revenue in question.\n\n", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": 1200.0, "extra": []}, "id": "20170203AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "Our major quantity of interest is the threshold beyond which the Citizen will choose not to punish the Leader.

Among the three oil treatments, thresholds will be lowest in the base condition, followed by the Framing and Ownership conditions. In other words, increasing ownership should yield increasing thresholds. \n4. Collective action should allow Citizens to coordinate on the highest possible threshold given their preferences, pushing up the average threshold relative to non-collective action conditions. \n\nWe expect heterogeneous treatment effects by experience paying taxes, gender, and perceptions of corruption. Women, those with experience paying taxes, and those with high perceptions of corruption should all be more likely to choose higher thresholds under some conditions. In particular, those with more experience paying taxes should have higher thresholds in the taxation condition than those with less experience.

We will then estimate a regression model predicting support for resettlement based on the following variables: local (1=local resettlement, 0=national), negative frame (1=in condition, 0 otherwise), positive frame (1=in condition, 0 otherwise), and interactions between local x negative frame and local x positive frame.

Therefore, we will investigate whether negative attitudes towards refugee resettlement are moderated by education. We will evaluate this interaction by using self-provided information on education levels provided in a previous wave. \n\nRQ2: Is NIMBYism more or less prevalent among participants with a large existing refugee population in their local community?\n\nEmpirical work has suggested that the density of immigrant settlement plays a role in shaping attitudes towards immigration, but only when debates are nationally salient (Hopkins 2010, 2011). We thus expect the effects of national frames to interact with the degree to which respondents are located within a community that has accepted refugees in the past. \n \nNotes: \n-We will compute and report appropriate auxiliary quantities from our models, including treatment effects by subgroup and differences in marginal effects between subgroups.\n-We will compute all marginal effects appropriate to test the hypotheses of interest from any interaction models described above.

Selective exposure is a theory that posits individuals are more likely to select information that aligns with their beliefs. It is possible that selective exposure may lead Chinese citizens to read more information that does not follow Communist Party ideologies. It is also possible that social endorsements may drive Chinese netizens towards specific information channels that are less supportive of the regime. This phenomenon would suggest that social media networks have introduced a degree of \u201cdemocracy\u201d to authoritarian regimes, as individuals can encourage others to read information that is incongruent with the government\u2019s issue alignment. This behavior may indicate that the Information Age poses a threat to the stability of authoritarian regimes. This study will clarify whether such effects exist.\n\nFew studies have examined selective exposure in authoritarian regimes. However, as the Internet makes information more accessible, the information environment has opened up in most authoritarian countries. A recent study suggests that selective exposure does play a role in information selection in China. Huang and Yeh (2016) found that Chinese citizens with higher pro-Western orientations are more likely to read articles that are critical of the Chinese government.\n\nSpecifically, we will use a conjoint analysis design to examine how the following factors affect what articles Chinese netizens are more likely to select to read: (1) news topic, (2) congruence with the Chinese government\u2019s issue alignment, (3) news source, and (4) number of social endorsements (e.g. \u201cLikes\u201d). We will also consider how the influence of each of the above factors is attenuated or increased by: (1) how often participants access a news source, (2) how much they trust a news source, (3) how nationalistic they are, and (4) how interested they are in political affairs.\n", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "1000-2000", "extra": []}, "id": "20170216AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "H1a: Chinese netizens are more likely to select articles that have topics related to government and politics (i.e. \u201chard\u201d topics), as opposed to entertainment news (i.e. \u201csoft\u201d topics).\n\nH1b: Chinese netizens who are apathetic towards politics are less likely to select news articles related to politics (i.e. \u201chard\u201d topics). \n\nH2a: Chinese netizens are more likely to select news articles that are incongruent with the Chinese government\u2019s position.\n\nH2b: Individuals who are more nationalistic are more likely to select articles that are congruent with the Chinese government\u2019s position. \n\nH3a: Chinese netizens are more likely to select articles from domestic, \u201ccommercialized\u201d news sources than domestic, government news sources. \n\nH4: Chinese netizens are more likely to select news articles on social media that have more social endorsements and are perceived as more \u201cpopular.\u201d\n\nRQ1: Will Chinese netizens\u2019 selective exposure behavior vary with various demographic variables (i.e. age, political affiliation, rural/urban residence, education level, income level)?\n\nRQ2: Will frequency of access to a foreign news sources influence selective exposure behavior?\n\nRQ3: Will nationalism influence the likelihood that Chinese netizens select foreign news sources or trust foreign news sources?\n\nRQ4: If political interest has an influence on selective exposure behavior, will its effects vary based on whether the topic is foreign politics or domestic politics?\n", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Selective Exposure on Chinese Social Media", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": 42782.0, "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "STUDY00030000", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Clara Wang, Yusaku Horiuchi, Sean Westwood", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Researchers", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "Demographic variables were included to improve efficiency of our estimation, if necessary.\n\nParticipants will be Chinese citizens age 18 and over recruited on the www.zhubajie.com online marketplace.

A few reasons have been advanced: cooperation in diverse communities might be hindered by prejudice and outgroup discrimination, by cultural differences and disagreement concerning norms and preferred outcomes, or by weak social networks and difficulties in communication and social control across ethnic groups (Habyarimana et al. 2009; Koopmans and Veit 2014; Kimenyi 2006; Algan, H \u0301emet, and Laitin 2011; Miguel and Gugerty 2005; Lieberman and McClendon 2013; Enos and Gidron 2016).\nHowever, ethnically diverse communities are often also poor communities, and thus diffused poverty, rather than ethnoracial diversity, might be at the basis of their lower cooperative capacity (Robert J. Sampson and Groves 1989; Robert J. Sampson, Raudenbush, and Earls 1997; Robert J Sampson 2012; Bruinsma et al. 2013; Abascal and Baldassarri 2015). Recent behavioral research suggests that scarcity produces a specific mind-set: in particular, people who are subjected to the stress of poverty 1) tend to discount the future more than people who do not live in conditions of chronic disadvantage, and 2) suffer from cognitive burden (Banerjee and Duflo 2011; Mani et al. 2013; Mullainathan and Shafir 2013; Haushofer and Fehr 2014). Here we theorize that these effects of poverty may influence cooperative behavior, as poor individuals might discard the future benefits of cooperation, and might be more erratic in their decision-making. In addition, poverty may also affect expectations: poor people might be considered less reliable cooperation partners, and might have fewer opportunities to participate in cooperative endeavors in the first place. In sum, poverty, as well as diversity, may be related to lower levels of cooperation. We turn to an experimental design to disentangle these two factors.\nTo test various hypotheses concerning the relative effect of ethnic diversity and poverty on cooperative behavior we developed a cooperative investment game and experimentally manipulate the identity of the interaction partner along racial and income lines. In addition, we compare behaviors in the cooperative investment game and a dictator game to distinguish between an underlying discriminatory bias against racial out-groups (and the poor) and discriminatory behavior based on expectations about alter\u2019s behavior. Taken together, our results will contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms that bring about cooperation in diverse communities. Given that poor people often live in communities that are both poor and racially diverse, our research findings might have far-reaching consequences for overall cooperation levels in contemporary societies.", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "~1200", "extra": []}, "id": "20170223AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "C90, D71, I32, J71, Z13", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "We will test hypotheses concerning the causal effect of alter\u2019s gender, income, and race in a bilateral cooperative investment task. Our major hypotheses concern the causal effect of alter\u2019s identity \u2013 namely his/her ethnicity and economic status \u2013 on ego\u2019s cooperative behavior. First of all, we expect that participants matched with a \u2018poor\u2019 alter will be less likely to invest. We speculate that this is because poor people tend to be more present-biased, while cooperation typically requires foresight and appreciation of future gains. Assuming that participants are (intuitively) aware of this, they will be more hesitant to invest when interacting with poor rather than rich subjects. \n\nBased on previous observational research, we also expect to find a lower propensity to invest in the cooperative game when participants are matched to Black partners. Lower levels of cooperation with ethnic minorities can be due to a variety of reasons, from imbued prejudice towards them (e.g., dislike of Blacks) to specific expectations about minorities\u2019 strategic behavior in cooperative contexts. If negative feelings toward Blacks were driving behavior, we would find lower contributions to Black partners in the dictator game and also find that contributions in the dictator game largely predict behavior in the cooperative investment game. In contrast, if lower cooperation is mainly due to expectations about Blacks\u2019 behavior, then we need to figure out whether these negative expectations are related to ethnicity per se \u2013 i.e., the belief that Blacks are unreliable \u2013 or whether ethnicity is used as a proxy for other factors, such as poverty. \n\nIn particular, it is possible that part of the discriminatory behavior toward Blacks is driven by considerations regarding the economic conditions of most Blacks. In the latter case, varying information about the economic conditions may affect these expectations. Our research design, allowing us to compare cooperation with high- and low-income Blacks and Whites is mainly intended to address this aspect. Namely, if ethnicity is simply a proxy of economic conditions, we expect that there are no differences in levels of cooperation towards Blacks and Whites once we consider their income status. In contrast, if negative expectations about Blacks exist, beyond economic considerations, we would find that blacks elicit less cooperation than Whites who are in their same income category.", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Cooperation across income and racial categories: Pre-analysis plan", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": 42681.0, "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": 42681.0, "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Max Schaub, Delia Baldassarri, Johanna Gereke", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Researchers", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "In order to measure cooperation, we developed a cooperative investment game. In the cooperative investment game, participants are given an endowment, and will have to decide whether they want to keep the endowment, or whether they want to invest their endowment. Keeping the endowment results in participants having the amount paid out immediately. Investing promises a 33% return on their investment after a two weeks wait. This return is only realized if alter chooses to invest, too, however. If the partner chooses not to invest, participants lose 20% of their endowment and still have to wait two weeks to be paid.\n\nHowever, our cooperative investment game adds a time dimension to what is basically a stag-hunt game (Skyrms 2004). This time dimension captures the extent to which individuals tend to discount future gains in favor of an immediate reward. According to recent psychological research (Mullainathan and Shafir 2013; Mani et al. 2013; Haushofer and Fehr 2014), this \u2018present bias\u2019 is quite common among the poor, and, we argue, could be at the origin of their reduced propensity to cooperate. The game was intentionally constructed this way to give us a measure of cooperation that sensitively depends on expectations about alter\u2019s willingness to cooperate, but also to reflect the fact that many real-life cooperation situations involve a time dimension.\n\nIn terms of data analysis, all hypotheses will be tested using OLS. For the cooperative investment game, we will additionally provide probit estimates. We use heteroskedasticity-robust (White) standard errors to account for the fact that our treatment groups will most likely be slightly unbalanced (as we use a simple randomisation procedure, where participants are allocated to conditions as they arrived) (Samii and Aronow 2012). We will control for pre-treatment characteristics of our subjects (sex, age, race, education, income, household size, occupation) to improve the precision of our estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will test hypotheses concerning the causal effect of our treatments, as well as gather empirical evidence from observational data, and estimate heterogenous treatment effects for subgroups of our sample.

Higher values = more accurate responses for all outcome measures except the quasi-continuous measures of perceptions of local/national unemployment and percentage foreign born (in those cases, higher values just mean perceptions of higher unemployment or foreign born).\n\nNotes: \n-For partisanship measures among the public, we will use respondent self-classification on a standard party ID measure and include leaners in the partisan groups. \n-For the elite sample, we use the following definitions:\n-Democrat=1, Republican=0: Includes respondents to the National Candidate Survey who indicated they are running for office as a Democrat; respondents to the public official survey who indicated they ran for office as a Democrat; and elites and public respondents not in those categories who personally identify as a Democrat\n-Democrat=0, Republican=1: Includes respondents to the National Candidate Survey who indicated they are running for office as a Republican; respondents to the public official survey who indicated they ran for office as a Republican; and elites and public respondents not in those categories who personally identify as a Republican\n-Democrat=0, Republican=0: Includes respondents to the National Candidate Survey who indicated they are running for office as independent/unaffiliated/third party candidate; respondents to the public official survey who ran for office but did not run as a Democrat or Republican; and elites and public respondents not in those categories who personally identify as an independent \n-The reference category for the elected official/candidate and appointed official indicators among elites is staff who work those officials and those who were hired by other means (e.g., directly through the civil service).\n-Because we intend to test hypotheses about differences in partisan factual polarization between elites and the public, we intend to pool our public and elite data. We therefore will not use the survey weights provided by ANES or YouGov to approximate a nationally representative sample. We will report the weighted survey marginals for the public samples and how they compare to the relevant elite survey marginals in an appendix.  \n\nH1:\n\nFor H1, we will first estimate a pooled model of the following form for the DVs where accuracy = higher values that includes fixed effects by issue and respondent and SEs clustered by respondent:\n\nFactual beliefs (where accuracy = higher values) = b0 + b1 * elite (0=public, 1=elite) + b2 * Democrat (0=not Democrat, 1=Democrat) + b3 * Republican (0=not Republican, 1=Republican) + b4 * elite X Democrat + b5 * elite X Republican + b6 * elected official or candidate (0 if no, 1 yes [elites only]) + b7 * appointed official (0 if no, 1 yes [elites only]) + b8 * female + b9 * college graduate (0 if no, 1 if yes) + b10 * non-white (0 if self-identify as white, 1 if self-identify as non-white) + b11 * age 18-29 (0 if no, 1 yes) + b12 * age 30-44 (0 if no, 1 yes) + b13 * age 45-64 (0 if no, 1 yes) + b14 * age 65+ (0 if no, 1 yes) + e\n\nWe will then compute the absolute value of the average difference in factual beliefs between Democrats and Republicans in the public (|b2-b3|), the absolute value of the average difference in factual beliefs between Democratic and Republican elites (|(b2+b4) - (b3+b5)|, and the absolute value of the difference-in-differences (|b4-b5|). We report differences in mean accuracy because the outcome variables are coded as either binary where 1=inaccurate, 0=accurate or ordered where higher values = more inaccurate. We take the absolute value of the D-R difference for the public and elites and the difference-in-differences because we are interested in levels of polarization, not its direction, and inaccuracy may be higher or lower for Democrats relative to Republicans for any given outcome measure. (We may also analyze or report the quantities above in directional terms (i.e., not take the absolute value) for expositional or analytical reasons.)\n\nWe will then estimate an identical model without fixed effects separately for each issue and examine the extent to which the overall relationship we observe holds at the issue level.\n\nIn addition, we will compare elite and public factual polarization on national issues where higher values indicate perceptions of greater prevalence (i.e., higher unemployment/foreign born). We will estimate separate models for each national issue using the approach described above to verify that the findings above hold for this different type of outcome measure. We may report these results in an appendix due to the coding difference for expositional reasons.\n\nFinally, among the set of issues where accuracy=higher values, we expect factual belief polarization to be higher for issues on which factual disputes are especially salient and controversial among partisan/ideological elites and the media: climate change, voter fraud, the tax system (i.e., the tax burden on the wealthy), and the distribution of federal spending (i.e., social versus military spending). We expect factual belief polarization to be less on issues that are more obscure or less closely aligned with the partisan/ideological divide: vaccines, foreign aid, and the deficit. \n\nTo test this, we will estimate a version of the pooled model described above with an issue group interaction and test whether levels of factual belief polarization are larger among elites relative to the public on high-salience issues compared to low. We will estimate a pooled model of the following form that includes fixed effects by issue and respondent and SEs clustered by respondent:\n\nFactual beliefs (where accuracy = higher values) = b0 + b1 * elite (0=public, 1=elite) + b2 * Democrat (0=not Democrat, 1=Democrat) + b3 * Republican (0=not Republican, 1=Republican) + b4 * elite X Democrat + b5 * elite X Republican + b6 * high-controversy issue (0=no, 1=yes) + b7 * elite X high-controversy issue + b8 * Democrat X high-controversy issue + b9 * Republican X high-controversy issue + b10 * elite X Democrat X high-controversy issue +  b11 * elite X Republican X high-controversy issue + b12 * elected official or candidate (0 if no, 1 yes [elites only]) + b13 * appointed official (0 if no, 1 yes [elites only]) + b14 * female + b15 * college graduate (0 if no, 1 if yes) + b16 * non-white (0 if self-identify as white, 1 if self-identify as non-white) + b17 * age 18-29 (0 if no, 1 yes) + b18 * age 30-44 (0 if no, 1 yes) + b19 * age 45-64 (0 if no, 1 yes) + b20 * age 65 (0 if no, 1 yes) + e\n\nWe will then compute the absolute value of the average difference in factual beliefs between Democrats and Republicans in the public on low-controversy issues (|b2-b3|), the absolute value of the average difference in factual beliefs between Democratic and Republican elites on low-controversy issues (|(b2+b4) - (b3+b5)|, and the absolute value of the difference-in-differences on low-controversy issues (|b4-b5|). We will then do the same for high controversy issues (|(b2+b8)-(b3+b9)|, |(b2+b8 + b10) - (b3+b9+b11)|, and (|b10-b11|), respectively) and compute the difference-in-difference-in-differences (|(b4-b5) - (b10-b11)|). \n\nH2:\n\nWe test this hypothesis by estimating one model for each issue on which government officials in our sample have relevant experience: local unemployment and voter fraud. For unemployment, we consider whether partisan factual polarization is lower among mayors, city council members, and city managers (for whom experience=1) than among other officials whose job responsibilities do not involve some aspect of the local economy (for whom experience=0). For voter fraud, we conduct two tests. First, we compare partisan factual polarization among state and local officials who ran for elected office (experience=1) to state and local officials who did not run for (i.e., were appointed to) state and local office (experience=0). Second, we compare partisan factual polarization across local government officials who report that their job involves the implementation of elections and/or the tallying of votes (experience=1) to local government officials who report that their job does not involve the implementation of elections and/or the tallying of votes (experience=0).  \n\nFor both unemployment and voter fraud, the model will take the following form:\n\nFactual beliefs = b0 + b1 * experience (0=no, 1=yes; described below) + b2 * Democrat (0=not Democrat, 1=Democrat) + b3 * Republican (0=not Republican, 1=Republican) + b4 * experience X Democrat + b5 * experience X Republican + b6 * elected official (0 if no, 1 yes) + b7 * appointed official (0 if no, 1 yes) + b8 * female + b9 * college graduate (0 if no, 1 if yes) + b10 * non-white (0 if self-identify as white, 1 if self-identify as non-white) + b11 * age 18-29 (0 if no, 1 yes) + b12 * age 30-44 (0 if no, 1 yes) + b13 * age 45-64 (0 if no, 1 yes) + b14 * age 65+ (0 if no, 1 yes) + b15 * unemployment level in respondent county + e\n\nTo test H2, we will compute the absolute value of the average difference in factual beliefs between Democratic and Republican officials who lack relevant experience (|b2-b3|), the absolute value of the average difference in factual beliefs between Democratic and Republican elites who have such experience (|(b2+b4) - (b3+b5)|, and the absolute value of the difference-in-differences (|b4-b5|), which tests whether partisan factual belief polarization is lower among officials with relevant experience than among those who lack it. \n\n(These models are estimated only among elites who responded to the public official survey on these issues.)\n\nH3:\n\nTo test H3, we will estimate separate models of the following form for unemployment levels and number of foreign born, the two issues for which we have both local and national perception measures:\n\nFactual beliefs = b0 + b1 * elite (0=public, 1=elite) + b2 * Democrat (0=not Democrat, 1=Democrat) + b3 * Republican (0=not Republican, 1=Republican) + b4 * local issue (0=outcome is perception of national unemployment or percentage foreign born, 1=outcome is perception of county unemployment or percentage foreign born) + b5 * Democrat X local issue + b6 * Republican X local issue + b7 * elected official or candidate (0 if no, 1 yes [elites only]) + b8 * appointed official (0 if no, 1 yes [elites only]) + b9 * female + b10 * college graduate (0 if no, 1 if yes) + b11 * non-white (0 if self-identify as white, 1 if self-identify as non-white) + b12 * age 18-29 (0 if no, 1 yes) + b13 * age 30-44 (0 if no, 1 yes) + b14 * age 45-64 (0 if no, 1 yes) + b15 * age 65+ (0 if no, 1 yes) + b16 * actual county value (foreign born or unemployment level in respondent county) + e\n\nFor each issue, we will then compute the absolute value of the average difference in factual beliefs between Democrats and Republicans on national issues (|b2-b3|), the absolute value of the average difference in factual beliefs between Democrats and Republicans on local issues (|(b2+b5) - (b3+b6)|, and the absolute value of the difference-in-differences (|b5-b6|). \n\nNotes: \n\n-This study uses four data sources: National Candidate Study, public official survey, general public survey, and ANES (all discussed above). Because the public official survey and general public surveys will be fielded at roughly the same time, we may limit our in-text discussion to these two data sources and report the National Candidate Study and/or ANES results in an appendix. If all four datasets are pooled to test H1, we will account for unobserved differences resulting from pooling with fixed effects.\n-We will compute and report appropriate auxiliary quantities from our models, including treatment effects by subgroup and differences in marginal effects between subgroups.\n-We will compute all marginal effects appropriate to test the hypotheses of interest from any interaction models described below. In some cases, we may present treatment effects estimated on different subsets of the data for expositional clarity. If so, we will verify that we can reject the null of no difference in treatment effects in a more complex interactive model reported in an appendix when possible.\n-Don\u2019t know responses will be considered missing data for the factual belief outcome measures. \n-We will also compute and report summary statistics for our samples. We will also collect and may report response timing data as a proxy for respondent attention.\n-The order of hypotheses and analyses in the final manuscript may be altered for expositional clarity.\n-Where applicable, regression results for binary dependent variables will be verified for robustness using probit. Regression results for individual ordered dependent variables will be verified for robustness using ordered probit.

In economics the use of field experiments have contributed to solving the problem of causal inference when other methods have failed to give a reliable measure of discrimination. The method has been successful in detecting ethnic and racial discrimination in different markets. However, there has been little investigation into the underlying mechanisms through which discrimination occur (Riach and Rich, 2002: 481; Bertrand and Duflo, 2016: 7\u20138). At the same time studies investigating discrimination done by public administrators has been sparse (Grohs et al., 2016; Butler and Broockman, 2011). There are no such studies in Denmark as far as the author is aware.\n\nThe debate on ethnic discrimination in the school system has recently gained attention in Danish media. The most notable example is the case of Langk\u00e6r Gymnasium (upper secondary school) where the administration decided to divide students into classes according to their ethnic origin. This caused a lot of uproar and the school was accused of discriminatory behaviour (Tv2, 2016; Politiken, 2016).\n\nWith this masters thesis I incorporate theories from social psychology and investigate ethnic discrimination on access to public and private primary schools in Denmark. Experience from psychology suggests that minimal conditions for group thinking are sufficient for out-group discrimination. In the ethnocentric view, a positive identification with ones own group often makes evaluation of out-groups negative and can lead to discrimination by simple group identification (Turner et al., 1979: 187\u2013191; Kam and Kinder, 2012: 335).\n\nWhereas theories like statistical discrimination and taste-based discrimination suggest that discrimination is a result of outcome rationality, theories in psychology suggest a more none-conscious act of discrimination \u2013 often called implicit bias (Bertrand and Duflo, 2016: 6\u20138). Statistical discrimination suggests that discrimination is a function of incomplete information about the subject. This leads to group-estimates that guide the decision maker when there is no other information available (Guryan and Charles, 2013: 418; Pager and Shepherd, 2008: 193). Taste-based discrimination suggests that discrimination is a function of xenophobic attitudes against members of a group (i.e. ethnic group). This xenophobic attitude is often seen as a predisposition, and so taste-based discrimination lags an explanation of the origin of xenophobic attitudes.\n\nHowever recent literature in political behaviour has shown that attitudes against immigrants often arise as a function of context, i.e. contact with and casual observation of immigrants (Hjorth, 2016; Dinesen and S\u00f8nderskov, 2015; Enos, 2014). The two contesting theories in this area are conflict theory and contact theory, which roughly predict opposite effects of inter-group contact.\n\nI test the different hypothesis derived from theory in a correspondence test, where information about pupil\u2019s skills and perceived ethnic origin (Middle Eastern and Danish) is manipulated in an e-mail sent to primary school administrations. The e-mail contains a brief message asking for relocation of the child to the contacted school and where information about the school can be found. A series of background data are merged onto the experimental data for further hypothesis testing beyond the manipulated variables.\n\nThe experiment uses deception in the sense that the e-mail contains a false identity. Due to the use of deception the study faces an ethical problematic. Therefore, the field experiment is designed carefully by weighing the costs and benefits of conducting the experiment. The principles guiding the design follows Riach and Rich (2004) where they discuss and outline what one should consider in a design to justify the use of deception (Riach and Rich, 2004).", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "ca. 1700", "extra": []}, "id": "20170225AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "Hypothesis and testing:\n\nH1: Primary schools on average discriminate against parents/children with Middle Eastern ethnicity in the e-mail correspondence between parents and the school.\n\nH2: Primary schools on average discriminate against the parents/children if the correspondence is an intra-group relation compared to an inter-group relation. \n\nH3: Discrimination against parent/child with Middle Eastern ethnicity is high in areas with relatively high degree of xenophobic attitudes as compared to relatively low degree of xenophobic attitudes.\n\nH4: Discrimination against parents/children with Middle Eastern ethnicity is lower if the child is signalled to have relatively good grades compared to no information about the child grades.\n\nH5: Discrimination against parents/children with Middle Eastern ethnicity is higher for schools that recently experienced growth in enrolment share of other ethnic background than Danish.\n\nH6: Discrimination against parents/children with Middle Eastern ethnicity is lower for schools with high degree of personal contact with people of other ethnic background than Danish.", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Ethnic discrimination in primary schools", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Jonas H\u00f8gh Jeppesen", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Researchers", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "What is the experimental design?\n\nThe design of the field experiment follows a 2x2 treatment where the first manipulated variable is perceived ethnicity, signalled through the use of ethnic names. \nThe recent refugee crisis in Europe has focused attention especially on the situation in Syria. However for more than a decade, migration in Denmark has mainly been from Middle Eastern countries (reference) and so salience in the debate about immigrants is likely skewed towards people from this area of the world. This is arguably a salient issue among many Danes and has most likely been a factor in changing the political landscape and support for the Danish Peoples Party (right wing nationalist party). Therefore the design uses Middle Eastern names to signal ethnic origin other than Danish. This means that discrimination is a measure of the differential treatment between the group of names of Danish ethnic origin and names of Middle Eastern origin.\n\nThe second manipulated variable is a measure of the pupil\u2019s skills as perceived by the primary school they are moving from. This treatment is signalled through a short text where the parent contacting explains that the child is doing well in tests according to the teachers at the current school. The text is followed by an explanation of why the parent wants to move the child anyway. The control for this variable is a simple exclusion of any information of the child\u2019s skills.\n\nDiscrimination is measured as a differential treatment. This includes content analysed e-mail reply from the primary schools and the reply time. The content analysed variables will be inspired by Grohs et al. (2016) and are as follows:\n\nCompleteness: The informational content. Are the two questions requested in the e-mail answered or not? NOTE: The full codebook and numeric scores have not yet been established.\n\nService orientation: Includes the thoroughness and degree of friendly tone in the response. Further provided information beyond the requested content. NOTE: The full codebook and numeric scores have not yet been established.\n\nFor further information see Grohs et al. (2016). \n\nAdditionally the name of the replier is coded into ethnic origin where Danish origin and Middle Eastern origin are the two main categories used. This is used to operationalize the intra/inter-group variable assuming that the name can be used as a proxy for ethnicity.\n\nTesting of hypothesis:\n\nH1: is tested by comparing average outcome scores for e-mails sent from Middle Eastern names and Danish names.\n\nH2: is tested by comparing average outcomes of intra-group e-mail correspondences with intergroup correspondences. The group relations are operationalized as match of group between parent ethnicity and school administrator\u2019s ethnicity, specifically the person replying.\n\nH3: is tested using a proxy for xenophobic tendencies in the geographic area of the school location. This proxy is assumed to measure the likelihood of the school staff or boards having xenophobic tendencies. For similar use of proxy see (Hainmueller and Hangartner, 2013). The variable is interacted with ethnicity to see whether areas with higher xenophobic tendencies have a higher degree of discrimination.\n\nH4: is tested experimentally by manipulating the content of the email in the correspondence (se previous description). Ethnicity and information about the child\u2019s skills are interacted to see whether the effect of ethnicity is lower among children with good skills compared to children without information about skills.\n\nH5: is tested using a lagged pre-treatment variable on growth in enrolment share of other ethnic background than Danish into the school. The variable is interacted with ethnicity to see whether the effect of ethnicity is higher among schools having experienced relatively high growth compared to low growth.\n\nH6: is tested using a proxy variable measuring the probability of personal contact with pupils of other ethnic background than Danish. Since the e-mail is directed at the administration of the school it is likely that they will not have the same rate of contact with the pupils as the teachers of the school. However assuming a constant rate of personal contact across schools the probability can be measured in terms of ethnic diversity, as the total share of other ethnic background than Danish. The variable is interacted with ethnicity to see whether discrimination is lower in schools with relatively high degree of ethnic diversity.", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "Denmark", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Registration prior to assignment of treatment", "extra": []}, "timestamp": "02/25/2017 - 05:03"}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": 42793.0, "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "Almost immediately after the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act (VRA), jurisdictions throughout the South sought subtle ways to subvert its enfranchising provisions.

Partisan selective exposure may exacerbate polarization (Stroud 2010) and lead members of opposite parties to hold different beliefs about political facts (Shapiro and Bloch-Elkon 2008).\n \nIn this project, we measure the extent of partisan selective exposure and investigate one potential strategy for reducing it. Specifically, we investigate whether information from non-partisan fact-checking organizations about the factual accuracy of news content mitigates partisan selective exposure. To test this hypothesis, we conduct a randomized conjoint experiment on Amazon.com\u2019s Mechanical Turk (MTurk).", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": 1700.0, "extra": []}, "id": "20170312AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "H1a:  Participants will be more likely to select articles that fact-checkers have found to be accurate compared to articles that have not been fact-checked.\nH1b: Participants will be less likely to select articles that fact-checkers have found to be inaccurate compared to articles that have not been fact-checked.\n \nH2: Partisans will be more (less) likely to select articles from co-partisan (out-partisan) sources compared to non-partisan sources.\n \nH3: Negative fact-checker ratings will decrease partisan selective exposure.\n \nRQ1: Are strong partisans more likely to engage in partisan selective exposure (compared to weak partisans and independent leaners)?\nRQ2: Are participants who are high in political knowledge and political interest more likely to engage in partisan selective exposure (compared to participants low in knowledge and interest, respectively)?\n", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Factual (In)accuracy and Partisan Selective Exposure", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": 42793.0, "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "STUDY00030155", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "D.J.

For us, the alternatives are two news articles (i.e., our outcome of interest is which article participants prefer to read). Each table will have 5 rows and 3 columns. The rows contain information on our two alternatives.

While these sources have ideological reputations, they are arguably less overtly partisan than the other sources we use. Thus, we do not consider the New York Times or Wall Street Journal in our main analyses. We may report additional results using these two sources in an appendix to assess robustness.\n-For testing the fact-checker hypotheses, we will merge all star-level ratings into a single category (e.g., 1 star ratings from PolitiFact, FactCheck.org, and WashingtonPost Fact-Checker will be treated as a single attribute). We may report additional results treating ratings from different fact-checkers as separate attributes in an appendix to assess robustness.\n \nStatistical analyses\n \nWe will use the \u201ccjoint\u201d package (Strezhnev et al. 2016) in R to estimate Average Marginal Component Effects and Average Component Interaction Effects.

We will then use participants\u2019 self-reported partisanship to recode each source as co-partisan, out-partisan, or neutral (leaners will be treated as partisans and pure independents will be excluded from this test). We will estimate AMCEs for co-partisan and out-partisan source (neutral will be the omitted baseline).\n \nH3: Negative fact-checker ratings will decrease partisan selective exposure.\n \nWe will interact the two attributes of interest\u2014partisanship of source and fact-checker rating\u2014and report ACIEs.\n \nRQ1: Are strong partisans more likely to engage in partisan selective exposure (compared to weak partisans and independent leaners)?\n \nWe will re-run the test of H2 on the subsample of strong partisans and report whether the AMCE associated with source is larger for strong partisans compared to weak partisans.\n \nRQ2: Are participants who are high in political knowledge and political interest more likely to engage in partisan selective exposure (compared to participants low in knowledge and interest, respectively)?\n \nWe will re-run the test of H2 on the subsample of high knowledge participants and report whether the AMCE associated with source is larger for high knowledge participants compared to low knowledge participants.

Third, we compare and evaluate three strategies for dealing with race-of-coder and spillover problems: (1) averaging multiple observations of the same subject; (2) allowing the coder to view the Massey Martin palette while she evaluates and records the skin color of the person she is coding, as suggested by Hannon and DeFina (2016); and (3) eliciting pairwise comparisons of skin color (rather than using the Massey Martin scale), and then inferring skin-color rankings using Bayesian item-response models.", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": 1600.0, "extra": []}, "id": "20170320AC", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "J15", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "The quantities of interest are defined formally in the attachment.\n\nWe test the following hypotheses about the Massey-Martin measure of skin color:\n- Respondents exposed to \"distractor\" photographs of whites will code \"target\" photos (of whites and African Americans) darker on average than respondents exposed to distractor photos of African Americans.\n- The distractor-photo effect is smaller when the respondent is provided with the Massey-Martin color palette alongside the photos to be coded, than when respondents are told to memorize the scale and not shown it alongside the photos.\n- Skin-color coding is moderated by the race of the observer.

This question examines whether subtle and brief group cues, such as language or professional status, can be perceived as a threat and affect Whites\u2019 attitudes toward outgroups when they are mediated by a message that does not aim to be political. Could advertisements have unintended political consequences? For example, would a native English speaker perceive an advertisement in Spanish as a cultural threat, and thus express negative attitudes toward immigration? Would images of wealthy or middle class Hispanics be less threatening than images of lower socio-economic status (SES) Hispanics? The answer to these questions will shed light on the causes of anti-immigration attitudes and the effect of subtle and brief outgroup cues in the media.\nThis study focuses on Hispanics, the largest minority and immigrant group in the United States, and argues that language, specifically Spanish, and socioeconomic cues in non-political advertisements can also affect attitudes toward immigration. Specifically, it is argued that exposure to advertisements in Spanish will produce negative attitudes toward immigration when feelings of anxiousness, confusion, irritation, etc., are triggered because the language is perceived as a cultural threat to the \"American way of life\", posing a barrier to interpersonal communication particularly for monolingual Americans. On the other hand, cues about Hispanics socioeconomic status (SES) in advertisements should affect attitudes toward immigration as well as perceptions about Hispanics economic well-being as a group. Portrayals of an individual of high SES, for example, could be seen more positively than portrayals of low-skilled workers, but they could also trigger a sense of threat if the viewer feels that the depicted individual enjoys a lifestyle the viewer cannot attain.

This channel is the first of its kind, presenting culturally appropriate content in Hausa written, produced, and filmed by veterans of the Hausa-language film industry based in Kano, Nigeria. The intended audience for this channel includes all of Muslim Northern Nigeria. This paper presents a preliminary assessment of the impact of this attempt to use television to change (or resist change) in attitudes in the context of violence and social change in Northern Nigeria and the Muslim world. \n\nThe channel has 4 prosocial goals: (1) to increase tolerance towards religious and ethnic outgroups; (2) to decrease acceptance for violence as a means to achieve goals; (3) to increase support for the empowerment of women; and (4) increase support for the empowerment of youth.

A large-scale survey was undertaken by the US Department of State in 2013, before Arewa24 launched.  That same survey, plus questions relating to Arewa24, was conducted again in late 2015, after the channel had been airing content for more than 1 year.  We first match 2015 viewers with 2015 non-viewers and compare the differences on our four outcomes of interest (tolerance, violence, women's empowerment, youth empowerment).  We then match 2015 viewers with 2013 non-viewers and compare them in a difference-in-differences design with 2015 non-viewers.  This difference-in-differences should account for changes over time that occur orthogonal to Arewa24.  The analysis will match on every variable we think could affect viewing Arewa24, missingness on those variables, and the proportions of those variables in the individual's neighborhood.  From that list, we will use a LASSO to select variables that do predict viewing Arewa24.\n\nSecond, we will analyze a pre/post survey conducted in conjunction with Arewa24.  Arewa24 conducted a baseline survey in late 2014, just before it began airing its flagship, award-winning drama program, Dadin Kowa.  Arewa24 then conducted an endline survey in early 2017, going to the same neighborhoods and, where possible, talking with the same people.  We will compare these neighborhoods over time, conditional on the percentage of Arewa24 viewers (expecting more change in places with more Arewa24 viewers).  We will also compare the people we were able to contact at both times points (2015 and 2017).  And we will compare Arewa24 viewers to non-Arewa24 viewers, perhaps using matching to make clear comparisons.  And perhaps a difference-in-differences design, predicting that Arewa24 viewers will change more than non-Arewa24 viewers over this period of time.\n\nThird, we will conduct a randomized encouragement experiment using Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology.  We will encourage people in Northern Nigeria to watch either (1) Dadin Kowa, Arewa24's flagship program, or (2) AIT, a rival channel; a control group (3) will not be asked to change their viewing habits.  We will assign viewers in blocks based on their previous exposure to Arewa24 and their gender, since we believe men and women will respond differently to the program, especially to the women's empowerment programming.

A large literature characterizes and estimates the welfare gains from trade, and identifies the mechanisms through which trade affects workers, firms and the aggregate economy. Some policymakers believe that international trade has effects beyond changing economic outcomes such as prices, expenditures, wages, employment and productivity. Trade may change individuals\u2019 views and attitudes towards other countries and cultures. For example, individuals who have directly benefited from international trade by selling their production abroad may hold more cosmopolitan views and be more favorable towards the values of their buyers.\n\nOf course, participation in international trade and an individual\u2019s views and attitudes may simply be correlated. It is hard to estimate the causal impact of trade on views and attitudes because of the difficulty of finding a convincing counterfactual since substantial evidence suggests that exporters differ from non-exporters. It is also difficult to estimate this relationship because one needs to complement trade data with surveys on individual attitudes. \n\nWe hope to make progress on these issues and provide the first rigorous evidence on how exposure to trade with Western Democracies affects participants\u2019 views and attitudes. We do this by utilizing the randomized allocation of export orders to rug-making firms in Fowa, Egypt, as described in Atkin, Khandelwal and Osman (forthcoming). In our sample of 219 rug-making firms, 87% had never knowingly produced a product for export markets at baseline. We randomized which firms received an initial export order from buyers located in OECD countries (treatment firms), primarily Germany and the US; and which firms did not (control firms). All orders passed through a local intermediary, and future orders were left to the discretion of the intermediary and foreign buyers. Takeup firms successfully filled their trial orders, and continue to obtain and fill subsequent export orders to these same markets. By comparing the outcomes of the treatment group to the control group we can estimate the causal impact of exporting. \n\nMore than five years after the initial randomization, and three years after our last follow up survey, we re-surveyed producers to collect information on their attitudes and world views. We developed a survey that focused on issues of economic equality, gender equality, information sources and international trade. Most importantly, given the geographic and historical context of our sample, we also asked questions about Western bias and attitudes towards terrorism. Our main hypothesis, as we outline below, is that trade with Western democracies decreases anti-Western bias and support for terrorism. \n", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": 219.0, "extra": []}, "id": "20170505AC", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "Our three hypotheses are: (A) international trade leads to a decrease in support for terrorism against trading partners; (B) international trade leads to a decrease in support for terrorism in general; and (C) international trade leads to an improvement in attitudes towards other countries and foreigners.", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Can International Trade Change Minds?", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "Sept 7 2016", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "MIT 160854627", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Adam Osman, David Atkin, Amit Khandelwal", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Hamis Carpets", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "Through regression analysis and randomized experiment", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "Egypt", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Registration prior to researcher access to outcome data", "extra": []}, "timestamp": "05/05/2017 - 14:36"}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": 41913.0, "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "The evidence is mixed as to whether women\u2019s descriptive representation in legislative bodies leads to improvements in women\u2019s substantive representation.

First, there may be stronger other-regarding preferences for \"in-group\" members. Second, elected representatives may have more contact with ingroup members that informs them about their policy priorities. Third, where a quota for a historically marginalized group is in place, it may induce a \"mandate and backlash\" effect in which the quota-eligible group feels mandated to work on behalf of the identity group for which they were quota-eligible, while the historically advantaged (and quota-ineligible) group backlashes in response to favor their group, perhaps in part due to status discontent.\n\nWe hypothesis that members of historically or currently politically marginalized groups, here women, will exhibit more ingroup bias than those from advantaged groups because the marginalization of the former makes group identity, and the above mechanisms, more salient. \n\nHowever, it is not obvious that these hypotheses will bear out. It might be that all politicians favor the historically-advantaged group, here men. Since being male is correlated with political participation acts that affect politician accountability pressures, politicians may be more responsive to men. Further, politicians may have internalized patriarchal norms that men belong in the public sphere, and women in the private sphere.

We expect identification with other federal parties, and the federal Conservative party in particular, to weaken voters\u2019 receptiveness to the council\u2019s views. We also measure the strength of the respondent\u2019s identification with their preferred party.\n\nIncome: We expect higher income individuals to be more receptive to the council\u2019s views. \n\nLeft-right ideology: We expect right-wing voters to be more receptive to the council\u2019s position on this issue. \n\nViews on state and individual responsibility: We expect individuals who think individuals should take more responsibility for their personal well being to be more receptive to the council. \n\nIdentity: We expect individuals with strong Canadian identities to be more receptive, than the average person, to the council\u2019s views. We expect individuals with strong provincial identities to be less receptive, than the average person, to the council\u2019s views. We do not expect individuals who identify equally with Canada and Manitoba to be any more or less receptive than the average respondent.\n\nPolitical Knowledge: We expect high-knowledge individuals to be less receptive to the council than low-knowledge individuals. \n\nEmployment status: We expect individuals to be less receptive to the council if they or a member of their household has been unemployed at any point over the last 12 months of the survey. \n\nAdditive effects (unrelated to treatment effects)\n\nIncome: In general, we expect higher income individuals to be more likely to agree that Manitoba unfairly benefits from the current transfer system and that Manitoba\u2019s transfers ought to be reduced.  \n\nLeft-right ideology: In general, we expect right-wing individuals to be more likely to agree that Manitoba unfairly benefits from the current transfer system and that Manitoba\u2019s transfers ought to be reduced.  \n\nViews on government and individual responsibility: We expect individuals who think that individuals should take more responsibility for their personal well being to be more likely to agree that Manitoba unfairly benefits from the equalization system and that Manitoba\u2019s transfers ought to be reduced. \n\nIdentity: We expect individuals with strong Canadian identities to be more likely, than the average person, to agree that Manitoba unfairly benefits from the equalization system and that Manitoba\u2019s transfers ought to be reduced.

The first piece of the survey is a study of whether informal sector workers are politically different from formal sector workers. Lots of literature in political science posits informal sector workers to be politically different--e.g., less participatory, more right-leaning--than formal-sector workers. These assumptions are rarely tested, however. I test whether informal workers have economic policy attitudes --namely toward the welfare state and labor market policies--that differ from those of formal sector workers.\nThe second piece of the survey is a preliminary study to collect pilot data on Mexicans' attitudes about labor market policies and reforms as well as their consequences. Genuine labor market reforms have been hard to come by in Mexico and in the broader Latin American region, so this creates a puzzle as to why reform that many if not most workers would benefit from are unpopular.

The reason for this is because the two sectors are much more integrated than scholars typically presume: informal workers anticipate being in the formal sector in the future, and/or many are married to formal workers. This leads to the second hypothesis: I DO expect a gap in attitudes between \"stable\" informal workers and \"stable\" formal workers, with stable informals preferring more noncontributory welfare policies and formals preferring more contributory ones. Stable informals are those who do not expect to be formal in the next five years, and stable formals are those who do not expect to be informal over the next five years.  The third hypothesis is that there will be a similar gap in attitudes between informals married to informals and formals married to formals, but being married to someone who is different on this dimension weakens or eliminates the gap.\n\nIn the second piece of the project, there are two experiments. One is a conjoint analysis.  It has respondents choose between two hypothetical job offers in which various features of the job--salary, pension, health coverage, severance pay, and ease of dismissal rules are randomly varied. The hypotheses about how these will affect job choice are rather straightforward: more salary, presence of pension deposits and health coverage,  greater severance pay, and rules against dismissal will increase the probability the respondent choose the job. What is more important is to observe the tradeoff between salary and fringe benefits. Do citizens implicitly value fringe benefits at their true monetary values or do they over- or undervalue fringe benefits? My hypothesis is that respondents will fringe benefits, which is why they tend to oppose labor market and welfare state reforms that would monetize benefits and create more flexibility and less paternalism.\n\nThe other experiment is inspired by a labor- and welfare-reform proposal made by economist Santiago Levy.

One scenario is a low inflation, low cost-of-living scenario and the other is a high salary, high cost-of-living scenario. The percentage increase in the cost of living over the status quo is the only thing that is varied (which is why this isn't really a conjoint analysis), and the percentage varies randomly between 5%  and 25% (reported to the whole number). The goal here is to see where the break-even point is. Are respondents indifferent between a salary increase of x% and inflation of x%, or are they more sensitive to one or the other?

Even before elected officials change laws and policies, do non-elected bureaucrats respond to protesters\u2019 demands?\n\nIn this study, we focus on a particular type of street-level bureaucrats (police) and ask how their behavior changed after a particular set of protests (the Black Lives Matter protests that swept across the US in December 2014). We seek to test whether police behavior changed in the wake of local Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests. Specifically, we ask whether police became less likely to make discretionary arrests for minor crimes, which would align with protesters\u2019 demands, or whether they exhibited a \u201cbacklash\u201d response to protests and made more of these arrests. We also collect data on police killings of civilians, and on crime clearance rates, as discussed below.\n\nThis research will yield a new understanding of both the impact of protest, and the behavior of street-level bureaucrats. If we find that police change their behavior to accord with protesters\u2019 concerns, this would suggest that protests can be effective in previously- unmeasured ways. If they do not react to protests, or if they instead show evidence of backlash, this would provide a cautionary tale to activists. It would also differentiate police from other unelected officials that have been shown to move with various measures of public opinion, such as judges (Giles, Blackstone and Vining, 2008) and social service workers (Weissert, 1994; Schram, College and Fording, 2007).", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "(not sure yet, but we're trying to collect the full set of cities over 30,000 population)", "extra": []}, "id": "20170613AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "We want to know whether police departments change their behavior after Black Lives Matter protests take place, particularly in the first few months after the protest (before there has been time for legislative responses and policy change).

So in essence we are testing three composite hypotheses: police show a pattern of responsiveness to protest, police show a pattern of backlash in response to protest, or police show a pattern of work stoppage in response to protest.\n\nWe will first run separate tests for each outcome variable (minor arrests, police killings of civilians, violent crime clearance rates) to see whether protests increase or decrease it, correcting for multiple testing.

When cooperation occurs, mayors and traditional authorities are able to leverage their respective strengths to provide more and better public goods. Yet, such cooperation does not always occur with important implications for within-district inequality. The research associated with this pre-analysis plan investigates the decision of community leaders to support some mayoral candidates over others. Community leaders vote for candidates that they expect 1) to reciprocate electoral support with benefits and 2) to address contingent demands that arise during the mayor's term in office.  I hypothesize that a sense of trust and reciprocity is best proxied by candidates' membership in a traditional community. Candidates need not be from the community of the traditional authority to receive support. Simply being from a community, as opposed to owning private property, is a sufficient proxy for trust and reciprocity that plays an important role in structuring the decision-making calculus of traditional leaders. \nThis question contributes to a longstanding literature on the interaction of state and traditional institutions (Lerner 1958, Huntington 2006, Diaz-Cayeros et al. 2014, Cramb and Willis 1990, Baldwin 2015). Specifically, it seeks to add to a recent and growing scholarship on the relationship between traditional authorities and politicians, focusing largely on the role of traditional authorities as brokers for politicians (de Kadt and Larreguy 2014; Baldwin 2013).  Under these models, traditional leaders support the candidates who can offer them resources and guarantee their survival. Yet, when are these promises credible? I argue that in Latin America shared membership in a traditional institution plays an important role in determining the degree to which traditional authorities trust mayoral candidates to address their concern and reciprocate support once in office. \nThe findings of this project may also have important implications for intra-district inequality in rural Latin America. If community leaders systematically support candidates from communities, and communities comprise a large enough proportion of the electorate to consistently elect these candidates, then we might expect communities to disproportionately benefit from municipal resources. Conversely, and as seems to more often be the case, if communities vote in blocs yet comprise a small proportion of the electorate, communities may receive unequal access to municipal resources.

Traditional communal landholding institutions in rural Latin America, especially Mexico and Peru, are characterized by traditional norms of reciprocity, where individuals help each other today with the expectation that they will be helped, if needed, tomorrow. Such traditions are only rarely associated with other forms of land tenure. Thus, candidates who are from communal landholding institutions are seen as more likely to share these norms of trust and reciprocity. Therefore, when a candidate is from a traditional community, they are more likely to receive support from community leaders than when they are not identified as a member of a community. Localism (i.e. membership in the same community as the community leader) is expected to exacerbate a shared sense of trust and reciprocity. Thus, candidates who are from the same community as the community leader are expected to be viewed even more favorably. These effects are expected to be stronger for current presidents than ex-presidents, as collaborations with mayors are more salient for current presidents than former ones. \n\nH1: Community leaders will be more likely to support candidates from their communities\nover those candidates who are not from their communities.

Moreover, the literature on the effects of civic engagement on violent extremism is not often interacted with education as a moderating factor.", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": 1200.0, "extra": []}, "id": "20170717AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "D74, I21C31", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "The research question posed by this study is: Do secondary education and civic engagement programs (interactively) reduce moral, material, and participatory support for violent extremist groups in Puntland and South Central Somalia? Secondarily, this question seeks to identify those causal pathways that may lead from secondary education and civic engagement programs to the support and participation outcomes. The mechanisms (treated as mediating variables) are:\n1. Violent extremist recruiters being attracted to increased human capital of secondary school graduates;\n2. Isolation and exclusion vis-\u00e0-vis the community;\n3. Optimism regarding future employment possibilities (and possible future disappointment in the realities of the job market);\n4. Impression of capacity to effect community change;\n5. Confidence in non-violence means of effecting change;\n6. Perception of government service provision capacity;\n7. Trust in government; and\n8. Perception of government discrimination.\nNote that the outcomes have been combined in a single continuum of discrete values, per the schema describing support for and opposition against a government originally proposed by Petersen (2001). Note, too, that there is no a priori directionality hypothesized for the relationship between education and support for violent extremism, given three competing pathways. In one, higher education attracts violent group recruiters looking for human capital. In a competing hypothesized pathway, increased optimism regarding future employment prospects militates against support for violent groups. In yet another, that optimism may be disappointed by the realities of a bleak economy that allow aspirations to go unfulfilled and fuel frustration. Finally, note that neither the increased human capital mechanism nor the employment disappointment mechanism are testable using this methodology. This is due to data constraints: we have not asked questions regarding whether respondents have been recruited by violent extremist groups, nor do we do not have time-series data on feelings regarding employment prospects during and then after secondary education.

Studying legitimacy is important for several reasons. As Tyler suggests: \"seeking to gain influence over others based solely on the possession of power is costly and inefficient. The use of power, particularly coercive power, requires a large expenditure of resources to obtain modest and limited amounts of influence over others\" (Tyler, 2006a: 376). Hence, increasing legitimacy may be a more cost-effective solution to inducing people to cooperate with an authority than investing in a coercive apparatus. Legitimacy then is relevant in any scenario in which an authority needs help from others: \ffirms (Akerlof, 2016), crime combat (Tyler and Fagan, 2008; Tyler, 2006b), terrorism (Dragu and  Polborn,  2014) and wars against insurgencies (Beath, Christia and Enikolopov, 2013; Berman, Shapiro and Felter, 2011; Crost, Felter and Johnston, 2016). This view is exempli\fed in the US Army Counterinsurgency Manual, which stresses the importance of legitimacy in conflict, when it states: \"Victory is achieved when the populace consents to the government's legitimacy and stops actively and passively supporting the insurgency.\" (Nagl et al., 2008: 1-3). Recently, there has been some experimental work that analyzes institutional sources of state legitimacy (Baldassarri and Grossman,2011; Dickson, Gordon and Huber, 2014, 2015; Grossman and Baldassarri, 2012). The results in these studies suggest that legitimacy may even have implications for development, as they a\fnd that legitimacy enhancing institutions may increase the levels of public goods provision. Through a lab-in-the field experiment in Mexico in which people will play a modified public goods game with punishment, this project analyzes whether certain policy actions, in particular giving transfers to people previous to public goods game may enhance the legitimacy of an authority and citizen cooperation.

President Trump\u2019s claims about various media outlets including CNN, the New York Times, and MSNBC spreading \u201cfake news\u201d have only added to a growing sentiment among the American population that the mainstream news media is untrustworthy. However, some evidence suggests that while Americans have low trust in the media in general, they trust media sources that they use\u2014and choice of media source is highly partisan in nature. This notion is consistent with a wide body of research pointing to a \u201chostile media effect,\u201d by which partisans rate identical news coverage as being biased against their side.

The question remains, however, as to how far individuals\u2019 trust in their preferred media source(s) goes.

Thus the impact of saving the first life is greater than the impact of saving the 1,000th life. It might even be the case that voters find it more psychologically meaningful to start a new program that saves 10 lives than to expand an existing program in a way that increases lives saved from 50,000 to 60,000. By a similar logic, voters might find it more psychologically meaningful to completely eliminate a small risk than to make a larger but marginal impact on a bigger risk. Paul Slovic, in particular, has argued that this mechanism helps to explain the so-called \u201cidentifiable victim effect,\u201d as well as Americans\u2019 reluctance to support humanitarian intervention.\n\nWe might expect that this psychic numbing phenomenon also applies to the way voters make sense of money, in the sense that expenditures should be more psychologically meaningful when compared to smaller baselines. In other words, voters might see it as being more \u201cexpensive\u201d to increase a program from $5 million to $50 million than to increase a program from $500 million to $600 million. The latter seems like a marginal increase while the former is an order-of-magnitude change.\n\nIf these mechanisms exist, then they would have important implications for shaping the way that the U.S. public evaluates risk management expenditures. In particular, these dynamics suggest that the public will be most willing to support spending funds to expand programs that are already well-funded, in order to reduce risks that are already quite small. In these cases, the psychic cost of the additional funding is low, and the psychic benefit of the risk reduction is high. By contrast, voters would be least willing to devote resources to programs that are currently poorly-funded, to reduce risks that are quite large. In these cases, the psychic cost of the additional funding is great, and the psychic benefit of the risk reduction is small.\n\nConfirming these findings would suggest a psychological foundation for path dependence in risk-related spending: the more expensive programs become and the smaller the risks they target get, the more likely people are to think that additional spending in these areas is worthwhile.\n", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": 2000.0, "extra": []}, "id": "20170721AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "Experimental vignettes (see attached) are designed to frame expenditures and lives saved with respect to varying baselines.

In modern developing countries, including in sub-Saharan Africa, taxation often looks quite different. Direct taxes, especially income taxes, are usually paid only by a small, urban elite. Poor citizens, especially in rural areas, typically pay far fewer, if any, direct taxes. Instead, developing countries have increasingly relied on  indirect taxes, including the Value-Added Tax (VAT), trade taxes, and excise taxes on specific goods. VAT in particular has been promoted by the World Bank and other development experts as an easier way to expand the tax base and increase tax revenues without unduly distorting economic incentives. However, there is little research on whether this shift from direct to indirect taxation might affect the ways in which taxation affects accountability. While there is increasing evidence that taxation can increase citizens\u2019 willingness to take costly actions to sanction leaders, we do not know whether this holds equally for all forms of taxation. Indeed, there are reasons to believe that while direct taxation should have a strong effect on citizens\u2019 political behavior, indirect taxation may have a weaker effect, or even no effect at all.

Recent scholarly and public attention has focused on the role of electoral gender quotas in increasing the number of female representatives in national parliaments (Krook, 2006; Schwindt-Bayer, 2009; Tripp & Kang, 2008), but less work has examined factors that increase women\u2019s representation in local politics, particularly in non-quota contexts. Women\u2019s participation in local government varies greatly across the globe, reaching near parity in some sub-national governments (e.g., Namibia, Costa Rica), while remaining near or below single digits in others (e.g., Angola, Panama). Few studies address this variation. Further, while there has been significant research on female candidate emergence and electoral success in Europe and the U.S., we know much less about the barriers to women\u2019s participation in local governance in developing countries. \n\nWe propose a study to test the barriers women candidates face in the political recruitment process, specifically related to candidate entry and electoral success. We investigate these questions in the context of Malawian local council elections. By law, Malawian local councils hold considerable local authority: they are responsible for enacting and enforcing national legislation, soliciting national funds for local infrastructure and economic development projects, and overseeing essential local services. In practice, the power of local councilors is yet to be seen, as they are serving for the first term in over a decade (Chasukwa, Chiweza, and Chikapa-Jamali, 2014). Despite a national campaign to increase the number of women elected to public office in Malawi (the 50-50 campaign), the 2009 and 2014 elections produced only modest increases in both national and local government. In the local council elections of May 2014, women made up 17 percent of the candidate pool and ultimately won 12 percent of local councilor positions (56 out of 457, country-wide). This represents a slight increase from the 2000 local elections, in which women won only 8.3 percent of councilor seats, but it is well below the 50 percent envisioned by the 50-50 campaign. To understand women\u2019s underrepresentation in local politics, we need to understand barriers women candidates face throughout the political recruitment process. \n\nIn the context of Malawi\u2019s most recent local council elections, we focus on four research questions related to women\u2019s underrepresentation in local governance. \n\nThe first two relate to candidate characteristics, namely: \n(1) What are the characteristics of women who seek elected office and how are these different than those of men candidates? \n(2) How do various other candidate features \u2013 such as political experience, family status, etc. \u2013 interact with candidate gender to affect the likelihood of electoral success? \n\nThe second two questions relate to how voters evaluate women candidates:\n(3) How do voters evaluate women candidates relative to men candidates and why? \n(4) How does the framing of national campaigns meant to increase women\u2019s representation affect voters\u2019 support for women candidates?  \n\nData on the first two questions will help us better understand barriers to candidate entry that may limit the pool of competitive women candidates and campaign-related constraints unique to women. Data on the third and fourth questions will allow us to identify how gender biases affect voters\u2019 demand for women candidates.

These events tend to reduce voters\u2019 incomes and diminish their living conditions.

Why do citizens change their political behavior after negative shocks? I plan to study how these adverse events change voters\u2019 political preferences. In particular, I focus on how natural disasters and crime victimization make candidates with certain labels more attractive to voters than others. Do crime victims tend to prefer right-wing candidates? Can natural disasters increase the probability of voting for left-wing politicians? The current literature about the political consequences of negative events tends to focus on voters\u2019 retrospective assessments of incumbents\u2019 performance. The main argument is that citizens (mis)attribute responsibilities after negative shocks, and punish or reward incumbents according to that (mis)evaluation. However, this approach fails to notice the importance of prospective political\npreferences. I hold that citizens, besides blaming or gratifying incumbents for their response to a negative event, are also selecting political authorities that can enhance their welfare. Victims focus on improving their living conditions after a negative shock, which leads them to pay attention to particular policy issues that can help them to achieve that goal. As a consequence, affected voters are more likely to select candidates that are better suited to address these new policy concerns.\n\nHow do voters know which candidate matches their new policy preferences? Victims can exploit certain labels to identify the politician that is more likely to implement the policies they most care about. For example, ideological labels (e.g., left and right) can work as informational shortcuts to connect candidates with simple policy outcomes (e.g., welfare and iron-fist policies).

Respondents will need to imagine they are disaster or crime victims. I follow a two-step procedure to select participants.\n\nIn the first step, I select the county that better predicts the electoral results in Chile. There have been six presidential elections in this country since the transition to democracy (1989, 1993, 1999, 2005, 2009, and 2013), and 32 candidates have competed in these elections. I compare the presidential electoral results in the 345 municipalities in Chile with the national electoral results. The analysis is straightforward; for each municipality, I sum up the absolute differences between this county and the national results for the 32 candidates that ran in the six presidential elections. The municipality with the lowest absolute difference was Cerrillos. This county is part of the Greater Santiago conurbation. Table 1 reports the vote share between Chile and Cerrillos, and it is useful to visually inspect how this municipality is an excellent predictor of the national electoral results (see document attached). In summary, the goal of this analysis is to avoid implementing the survey in counties that are outliers and do not represent the average political preferences in Chile.\n\nIn a second step, I will select respondents within Cerrillos. This municipality can be divided into four neighborhoods: Lo Err\u00e1zuriz, Divino Maestro, Villa M\u00e9xico, and Cerrillos. One enumerator will be assigned to each neighborhood, and within this area, we will use a random walk to select every 3rd household in a given street. It is expected that enumerators will cover the entire neighborhood by the end of the survey implementation. This study will be conducted by four enumerators in August 2017.\n\nThe questionnaire can be divided into five sections.\n\nThe first part will ask for general political opinions: evaluation of the president, voting preferences, etc.\n\nThe second part will ask for respondents\u2019 background characteristics: age, education, etc.\n\nThe third part will attempt to learn if citizens are capable of connecting simple policy ideas with ideological labels. In particular, it will ask participants to link social and iron-fist policies with left or right-wing politicians.\n\nThe fourth part will use an experimental design by providing three different scenarios to participants: to be a disaster victim, to be a crime victim, and a control condition (no extra information).\n\nThe disaster condition will say: \"Imagine you are a disaster victim. Yesterday there was a 9.0 earthquake in Santiago that destroyed an important part of your house and your belongings. Please take five seconds to think about the personal consequences of this disaster [WAIT FIVE SECONDS].\"\n\nThe crime condition will say: \"Imagine you are a crime victim. Yesterday three people violently entered your house and stole you important and expensive belongings. Please take five seconds to think about the personal consequences of this crime [WAIT FIVE SECONDS].\"\n\nThe control condition will not provide information about a disaster or a crime.\n\nThe outcome for disaster victims is: \"Taking into account the post-disaster context, do you think that authorities to help victims of natural disasters should distribute social policies or that every person is responsible for his/her own welfare?\"\n\nThe outcome for crime victims is: \"Taking into account the post-crime context, do you think that authorities to reduce crime should apply iron-fist policies or should focus on rehabilitation of criminals?\n\nParticipants in the control condition will receive both questions (but without the phrase: \"taking into account the post-disaster/crime context\").\n\nThe fifth part will use a conjoint experiment to measure respondents\u2019 electoral choices. Participants will be asked to decide between two (non-real) candidates that will be competing for the position of president in the 2017 elections. Respondents will see information about three attributes of these two presidential candidates: ideology (left and right), profession (gardener, teacher, engineer), and age (30, 40, 50). These attributes will be randomly chosen to generate the candidates\u2019 profiles (Hainmueller, Hopkins and Yamamoto, 2014). Each of the respondents will have to evaluate five pairs of profiles and select one candidate for president. The treatment condition will be repeated by the enumerator. I include ideology as an attribute because this is a relevant political label in Chile, and should help voters to identify the candidate that will implement the policies they most care about. I also include education and age because these attributes can provide signals of candidates\u2019 competencies to address the consequences of a negative shock. These two characteristics might be seen as valence issues by voters.\n\nI use the fourth part of the survey to compute statistical power. In order to achieve 80% power, I will need to have a sample size of at least 871 subjects (disaster treatment, crime treatment, and control).\n\nRegarding hypotheses 1 and 2, I will regress the outcome (policy preferences) on a treatment indicator (1: disaster or crime victim, 0: control). I will also include a model with controls that should predict the outcome (e.g., age, education, and ideology). I expect that the disaster treatment will increase support for welfare policies. Meanwhile, the crime treatment will increase support for iron-fist policies.\n\nRegarding hypotheses 3 and 4, the empirical strategy will be based on an interaction between the candidates\u2019 attributes (conjoint experiment) and the hypothetical scenarios (vignette experiment). This interaction (see document attached) describes the change in effect of the candidates\u2019 attributes between control and treatment conditions (disaster or crime victim). I expect that the disaster treatment will increase support for left-wing candidates. Meanwhile, the crime treatment will increase support for right-wing candidates.\n\nRegarding hypotheses 5 and 6, I need to show that a majority of respondents (>50%) are able to link social policies with left-wing politicians and iron-fist policies with right-wing politicians.", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "Chile", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Registration prior to any research activities", "extra": []}, "timestamp": "07/28/2017 - 12:20"}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": 42944.0, "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "This study employs an experimental manipulation of interpersonal trust to examine the link between social and political trust.

While traditional theories do not ignore these factors, they have tended to treat them as assumptions, rather than testable hypotheses, in large part due to a lack of data and methods necessary to conduct such tests. The advent of experimental methods, however, provides an opportunity to test reputation and leader characteristics in a controlled setting. In a recent publication, Renshon, Dafoe, and Huth exploit this opportunity to test an original theory about the effects of a reputation for resolve in international disputes. Their study combines and expands the notions of country-specific and leader-specific reputation, developing what they call a theory of \u201cinfluence-specific reputation.\u201d In short, they find evidence that reputations adhere to both countries and specific leaders.  Moreover, they find that leader reputations become more important when leaders are perceived to exercise greater or less-restricted control over decisions.\nThis paper seeks to extend the findings of Renshon, Dafoe, and Huth in two ways. Specifically, we will first endeavor to generalize their theory beyond the United States. In order to do so, we will change their second study to a bilateral one, measuring the reputational imputations of citizens of Pakistan and India about each other\u2019s leaders.

In other words, how much do respondents\u2019 pre-trial assessments of a leader\u2019s resolve change when they are introduced to new information and how does the effect of that new information change based on their prior beliefs? We thusly hope to illustrate that Renshon, Dafoe, and Huth\u2019s findings are valid in a new context, and that prior beliefs affect the way respondents interpret and respond to the information given in their study.

Public support for courts is supposedly a source of power for judges, helping to create pressure on state officials for the proper implementation of judicial orders. Although people generally have little information about what courts do and how the state responds to judges, then can be informed about these processes. Common models of judicial-government interactions assume that citizens generally prefer that state officials comply but that reactions to evidence of non-compliance should be less negative when judicial orders lack clarity, when the financial costs of compliance to the state are high, and more negative when the victims of state non-compliance come from vulnerable populations. Our goal is to consider empirically how people react to news of non-compliance.  The study draws on previous research tracking compliance with direct orders from judges to state officials in the context of the Colombian tutela in 2014, a legal instrument designed to provide swift redress for the violation of constitutional rights. A nationally representative sample of Colombians will be informed of the results of the previous study, which uncovered a significant degree of non-compliance with judicial orders. The primary piece of information for the study we report is that the overall non-compliance rate 30%. This rate suggests that roughly 127 out of 100,000 Colombians experienced non-compliance in the tutela in 2014. To put this in context, the murder and automotive fatality rates in Colombia in the same year were 31 and 17 per 100,000, respectively.

First we propose that individuals will be less accepting of non-compliance and more willing to contribute when they learn about the overall compliance rate from our study (30%). Second, among those who know about the study's key finding, we propose that individuals are more likely to find non-compliance acceptable when they know that (a) judges often issue vague orders, and (b) compliance often requires the spending of considerable state resources. We also propose that they are less likely to find non-compliance acceptable when they know that the beneficiaries of state compliance have low SES.  Third, among those who know about the study, we propose that individuals are less likely to contribute to an effort to improve compliance rates when they know that (a) judges often issue vague orders and (b) compliance often requires the spending of considerable state resources. They are more likely to contribute when they know that the beneficiaries of state compliance come from vulnerable populations. \n\nThe study also considers individual support for potential policy remedies. We propose that individuals are more likely to support a training program for judges in the drafting of clear orders in tutela than a program designed to simply provide information to the public about compliance rates when they know that judges often draft vague orders. We also propose that individuals will be less likely to support an increase in criminal penalties for non-compliance than the provision of information when they know that judges are often vague and that compliance often requires the spending of considerable state resources. \n\nWe consider several possible heterogenous effects. First, we consider whether the effect of learning about the overall compliance rate depends on individual expectations. Individuals should be less (more) accepting of non-compliance and more likely (less likely) to contribute to a program designed to improve compliance rates when the rate we report is above (below) their expectations. Second we propose that the negative effect of learning about the overall non-compliance rate on the acceptance of non-compliance is particularly strong among those individuals who hold strong beliefs in the rule of law. Third, we consider whether the positive effect of learning about the overall non-compliance rate on the willingness to contribute to a program aimed at improving compliance is particularly strong among those individuals who are particularly likely to engage in social sanctioning. Fourth, we consider whether answering pre-treatment questions about the rule of law and social sanctioning increases the negative effect of learning about the non-compliance rate from our study. \n\nOur pre-analyses plan develops these ideas further.

All respondents are adults and Colombian citizens. Our pre-analysis plan provides a full description of the design as well as the analysis we intend to conduct. The following is a summary. Respondents are randomly assigned to 1 of 8 groups. Each group consists of 400 individuals. All groups are provided a short summary of the tutela. They are also informed of the legal requirement of state officials to comply with judicial orders. Groups 1-7 answer several questions pre-treatment; Group 8 does not. Groups 1 and 2 do not learn about the study's results. Group 2 provides an expectation about compliance; Group 1 does not. All other groups (i.e., Groups 3-8) learn about the study's non-compliance rate. Groups 2, 4 and 8 learn nothing else about the study. Group 4 gives an expectation about compliance. Groups 5-7 further learn exactly one additional feature of the study\u2019s results. Group 5 learns that judicial orders are often vague. Group 6 learns that compliance often involves spending considerable state resources. Group 7 learns that the beneficiaries of compliance often have very low levels of education.\n\nTo measure the acceptability of non-compliance we use a 7 point Likert scale. To measure willingness to contribute, we give respondents the ability to donate \u201cNetQuest points\u201d (which are ultimately exchangeable with U.S. dollars). Our measure is simply the number of points that a respondent donates to a program designed to inform the Colombian public about compliance in tutelar. Treating these measures as normally distributed random variables, we compare means across groups via linear regression, using indicator variables for each treatment condition and fitting models with and without pre-treatment covariates. To evaluate the effects of judicial order vagueness, the cost of compliance, low SES of beneficiaries, as well as the possible effect of answering the pre-treatment questions, we limit the analysis to groups that learned about the study\u2019s overall non-compliance rate. Thus, Groups 1 and 2 are excluded from the analysis. We also exclude Group 4. Members of Group 3 serve as the baseline for comparison. To learn about the effects of simply learning about the study itself, we fit the same models but let the members of Group 1 serve as the baseline. Members of Groups 2 and 4 continue to be excluded from analysis.  \n\nTo evaluate the effects of prior expectations, we use Groups 2 and 4. Members of Group 2 who report an expectation about compliance very close (see pre-analysis plan) to what we report serve as the baseline for comparison. We fit a multiplicative interactive model that allows us to estimate the effect of learning about the study\u2019s compliance rate, conditional on whether a respondent reported a prior belief above, below or very close to what we report. This is accomplished by interacting the Group 4 indicator with indicators for whether respondents had beliefs, above, below are close to the rate we report.     \n\nTo evaluate the possibility that rule of law beliefs and commitments to social sanctioning change the effect of learning about the study\u2019s results, we focus on Groups 1 and 3. We fit a multiplicative interactive model that allows us to consider whether the effect of learning about the study depends on either rule of law beliefs or commitments to social sanctioning. This is accomplished by interacting an indicator for being in Group 3 with a scale for rule of beliefs (in the model of acceptability) and social sanctioning (in the model of willingness to contribute).  \n\nFinally, to evaluate the effects of learning about judicial order vagueness, the cost of compliance and the SES status of beneficiaries on potential policy remedies, we fit a multinomial logistic regression using indicator variables for each treatment condition. Our sample includes the members of Groups 3, 5, 6 and 7.  The dependent variable is a three category policy variable. Respondents can choose to support a policy that (1) provides information to the Colombian public about compliance, (2) requires judges to take a training course on writing clear orders in tutela and (3) increases criminal penalties for non-compliance in tutela. Comparisons across groups are made with the information provision option serving as the baseline category.

One key goal of the conjoint experiment is therefore to confirm what the available quantitative evidence suggests: voters do not prioritize rewarding or punishing incumbents as part of their voting calculus. \n\nMore broadly, if the quantitative evidence is confirmed, I also aim to address the puzzle of why Peruvian voters seem to be voting in ways that are opposite from the mechanisms theorized in electoral accountability, and that have often been shown to exist in empirical work in other settings. In that vein, I aim to test my overarching hypothesis that what explains these aggregate quantitative results is that five assumptions behind electoral accountability do not hold up in the Peru context. First, researchers typically assume ex-ante knowledge of the performance criteria that voters value, then test indicators of that performance for evidence of rewarding or punishing incumbents.  Second, electoral accountability assumes that the desire to reward or punish the incumbent is the primary criteria guiding voters\u2019 decisions at the ballot booth.  Third, for electoral accountability to work, it is assumed that voters are willing to give the incumbents a chance at a second term in office if they do a good job.  Fourth, electoral accountability assumes incumbents have a desire to win re-election. One final assumption is that voters see electoral accountability as the main or best way to hold their mayors accountable. I test the alternative hypothesis that voters are not using electoral accountability because they know that they can oversee the mayor\u2019s performance throughout her term in office through social accountability efforts, either formal or informal, such as direct advocacy or protest. \n", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Using Conjoint Analysis to Study Voter Preferences and Electoral Accountability in Peruvian Local Elections", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": 42957.0, "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "IRB16-0872; MOD16-0872-02", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Julie Anne Weaver", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Researchers", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "These hypotheses are tested through a conjoint experiment embedded within an original household survey being implemented in 18 urban, peri-urban and rural municipalities in the region of Cusco, Peru.

Media coverage in the U.S. is at best loosely related to local crime conditions (Graber, 1980; Lowry, Nio and Leitner, 2003) and often reinforces stereotypes of black criminality (Gilliam et al., 1996; Grabe and Bucy, 2009). Yet the growing availability of video footage of citizens interactions with the police, recorded by both individuals and police departments, may fundamentally change this process. By providing a more direct account of what happened, these videos may lead citizen to rely less their on preconceived notions of race and crime and make them more likely to agree on what happened and what \ufb02aws exist in the current system. In this study, we explore the consequences of viewing instances of police brutality on citizens attitudes about crime, justice, and politics more generally, in two ways. First, we explore the extent to which evaluations of the same unedited police body-worn camera footage of tra\ufb03c stop that resulted in a citizen\u2019s complaint can be in\ufb02uenced by changing the justi\ufb01cation and result of the release of that footage. By manipulating the title of the video, participants are informed that the released footage either con\ufb01rmed or refuted a charge of o\ufb03cer misconduct. Participants responses in these conditions are compared to those in control condition in which no justi\ufb01cation for the release of the footage is given. Second, we explore the e\ufb00ects of such footage when mediated through the frames of local news. Again, we compare participants evaluations of the interaction when it is framed as either con\ufb01rming or refuting the charge of o\ufb03cer misconduct to a neutral presentation of the information. We do so by manipulating the text of three written news articles, and the video of a local broadcast news clip of the event.

Second, does the formation of beliefs about what this footage shows depend on the format in which is presented. Speci\ufb01cally, do patterns of interpretation di\ufb00er when the footage is presented directly in an unedited manner compared to when it is mediated through the format of a news broadcast. Finally, we consider how prior beliefs about the criminal justice system (CJS) may condition the impact of the justi\ufb01cation and format of such footage. From these questions we de\ufb01ne a set of four possible patterns of response, detailed below, to the framing and format of the body camera footage some of which are conditional on prior CJS beliefs.

Generally speaking, the treatments consist of both raw body camera footage and slightly altered news coverage (both televison and newspaper) of a traffic stop in Memphis, TN. We use these treatments to test the following hypotheses:\n\nHypothesis 0. Interpretations independent of justi\ufb01cation for release of body camera footage\nHypothesis 1. Interpretation consistent with justi\ufb01cation for release of body camera footage\nHypothesis 2. Interpretation consistent with justi\ufb01cation for release of body camera footage conditional on prior beliefs\nHypothesis 3. Interpretation counter to justi\ufb01cation for release of body camera footage conditional on prior beliefs\n\nOur general expectations with regard to these hypotheses are as follows. If police body camera footage provides a purely objective view of an interaction, than it is possible that respondents will be unmoved by the manipulation of the justi\ufb01cation for the footage of the release or by the format in which this footage is presented (H0). We think this is unlikely and instead expect interpretation in the con\ufb01rmation and refutation treatments to di\ufb00er from condition in which no justi\ufb01cation is given.\n\nAs for the direction of those di\ufb00erences, we believe this pattern of response further depends on the format of the footage and the beliefs of those viewing it. We suspect that the \u201cobjective\u201d nature of the unedited body camera footage will make evidence of interpretations consistent with the framing (H1, H2) more likely than interpretations counter to the framing (H3). Further it seems likely that magnitude of these e\ufb00ects will be concentrated among respondents for whom the footage would seem to provide new information (H2). In contrast, we suspect that when this footage is presented as part of a news segment that may format activate familiar scripts about race and crime making a pattern of response of counter arguing the justi\ufb01cation more likely (H3).\n\nWe believe prior beliefs will shape the interpretation of this footage. Such beliefs are likely intertwined with the race of our respondents. We will conduct our tests separately for groups that objective indicators such as rates of incarceration suggest are relatively advantaged (Whites and Asians) and disadvantaged (Blacks and Latinos) within the current criminal justice system. In this analysis we expect that that the relative e\ufb00ectiveness of the justi\ufb01cation framing may di\ufb00er by group and prior beliefs. Thus, Blacks and Latinos, who are more likely to hold negative beliefs about the general fairness of the police, may be more more response responsive to the con\ufb01rmation framing (H1, H2) and more likely to counter argue the refutation framing (H3). In contrasts, Whites and Asians may be more likely to counter argue the con\ufb01rmation framing (H3) and more likely to accept the refutation framing (H1,H2).", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": 43101.0, "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "United States", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Registration prior to any research activities", "extra": []}, "timestamp": "08/19/2017 - 07:43"}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": 43009.0, "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "One of the most consistent findings in the field of contemporary political science is that the vast majority of people know little about politics (Converse, 1964; Delli Karpini & Keeter, 1996).

Yet, the mechanisms under which some women politicians garner political support, while others do not, remains opaque. This study examines the relationship between the implementation of gender quotas and attitudes regarding women politicians in Tunisia. Specifically, we pursue two important lines of inquiry: (1) Is support for women politicians conditional on the level of political office for which she is competing? (2) What rhetorical strategies can female politicians adopt to increase popular support for their inclusion in political office? In order to shed some insight on these questions we employ a multi-method study. First, we conduct we conduct elite interviews with politicians and leaders of civil society organizations, specifically debates about female MPs and gender quotas. Second, we conduct two different survey experiments that allow us to gain greater empirical leverage on the questions outlined above. To answer the first, we employ a candidate conjoint survey in which we randomize (1) candidate traits and (2) the level of political office.

First, we expect to see heterogeneous effects across the gender of the respondent, as previous research indicates that women are more likely than men to support female candidates and gender quotas. Further, we expect to see heterogenous effects across respondents who live in locations where women are represented in politics as opposed to respondents who live in locations where women are not represented in politics. Lastly, we expect to see heterogenous treatment effects across partisan and ideological viewpoints. For example, we measure pre-treatment attitudes regarding gender equality (taken in part from the Arabarometer and Afrobarometer surveys). We expect that respondents who express a stronger belief in gender equality will be more likely to support women candidates. Likewise, we measure three pre-treatment attitudes regarding religion in politics, and we expect that respondents who are open to the influence of religion in politics will be more amenable to the female candidate who appeals to traditionalism than others. \n\nFinally, we will also examine heterogenous treatment effects for the candidate rhetoric experiment.

This will allow us to understand how gender interacts with these other factors as voters choose their representatives (Hainmueller et al., 2014).\n\nThe question is constructed as a conjoint experiment in which the participant is presented with a set of side-by-side comparisons of two politicians described by a set of attributes. The respondents are asked to select which candidate they prefer. They complete this choice task 4 times. Although this option is not read aloud to them, respondents can also say that they do not like either. \n\nThe second survey experiment will randomize whether participants receive information about a woman candidates' focus on security issues, women's descriptive representation,  traditional or religion practices, or a control condition, and ask participants to rate their support for this woman candidate. This design will allow us to cleanly identify the impact of these different rhetorical strategies on support for female candidates, above and beyond observational analysis. Moreover, this design allows us to advance recent scholarship which only highlights the importance of gender stereotype (Bauer, 2017), and beliefs about leadership ability (Benstead et. al, 2015) on attitudes, as we also consider the rhetorical strategies that can be used to reduce negative attitudes about women politicians.

In most social settings, the members of groups experience a variety of inequities which may or may not affect their willingness to accept social outcomes and/or cooperate to produce collective goods. This study investigates the relative strength of two particular forms of inequity on the acceptance of group outcomes and social cooperation: process equity and outcome equity. \n\nProcess equity is obtained when all members of a group perceive that the process leading to social outcomes \u2014 however inequitable those outcomes might be \u2014 does not disadvantage any member of the process. More formally, a process is equitable if the expected value (this might be money, or something more amorphous like \u201cutility\u201d) of being part of the process is equal for all actors inside that process. Less formally, a process is equitable if everyone who is part of a given process has a \u201cfair shot\u201d at deriving value from the outcomes produced by the process.\n\nOutcome equity is obtained when all members of a group obtain the same outcomes or outcomes of equivalent value in more complex settings (again, this might be money or utility), regardless of the process that leads to those outcomes. More formally, the realized values that actors obtain from a process after its implementation are equal, whether or not expected values inside the process are equal.\n\nWhile previous studies have shown that both types of equity influence individual and group behavior, the relative strength of these forms of equity or inequity on social behavior and their interaction is difficult to investigate for a simple reason: equitable processes are likely to lead to more equitable outcomes, which makes it difficult to disentangle the relative importance of process versus outcomes for cooperation and the acceptance of group outcomes. This laboratory experiment parses the relative importance of process equity and outcome equity. It addresses whether an equitable process increases acceptance of inequitable outcomes and whether an inequitable process only impedes social cooperation to the extent that it produces inequitable outcomes. Our experiment aims to uncover when the promotion of process equity will be most important for ensuring acceptance of social outcomes and social cooperation.\n\nFor this study, subjects will be randomly assigned into one of two simple lotteries, one with higher expected value than the other; a simulated opponent will automatically be placed into the other.  Some subjects will be assigned to the better lottery based on a coin flip (equitable process) while others will be assigned based on a dice roll (inequitable process: 1 in 6 chance of being placed into the better lottery).

In this project, we theorize that home countries can have a significant impact on political risk in three ways. First, we argue that powerful states, namely the United States, have the ability to pressure host governments to uphold the contracts struck between multinationals and host government. We thus theorize that investments from the United States and, to a lesser extent China, will be perceived as less risk than other, less powerful countries (Canada, and UK).\n\nHypothesis 1:  Respondents will perceive that US investors are less risky than equivalent investments from other countries.\n\nSecond, we theorize that one mechanisms through which countries can leverage countries to uphold contracts with multinationals is through the use of suspension of foreign aid. Thus, countries that are more dependent on an investor\u2019s home country foreign aid are less likely to renege on contracts with these investors. This leads to our second hypothesis.\n\nHypothesis 2:  Respondents will perceive that investors from countries that are major aid donors are less risky than equivalent investments from other countries. \n\nOur final two theoretical mechanisms explore how the existence of bilateral investment (BITs) treaties reduce risks for foreign investors. One strand of literature argues that BITs are largely a signal of a country\u2019s willingness to uphold the rule of law with investors. Thus, a country that signs BITs with any country, is less likely to violate the contracts with foreign investors, even if the foreign investor isn\u2019t from a country that has signed and ratified such a treaty itself. \n\nHypothesis 3:  Respondents will perceive that foreign investments into countries that have BITs with any country a less risky than equivalent investments from other countries.\n\nAn alternative mechanism is that that BITs are a legal mechanism that protect investors from signatory countries.  This leads to our final hypothesis.  \n\nHypothesis 4:  Respondents will perceive that foreign investments into countries that have BITs with the country of origin of the investor are less risky than equivalent investments from other countries.\n\nOur conjoint survey also includes a number of other country and project level attributes.

Specialized insurers also cover political risk insurance, including organizations such as Sovereign LLC. Other major insurers such as Lloyds of London, Swiss RE, Zurich, and AIG have groups providing political risk insurance coverage.  \n To identify potential participants in our survey we took the following steps.\na)  We used the political risk industry association, the Berne Union, to identify the major companies involved in political risk insurance.

These companies include:\nAIG (US)\nAtradius (Netherlands)\nChubb (UK)\nCoface (France)\nExport Development Canada (Canada)\nEFIC Australia\nEuler Hermes (Germany)\nEKF (Denmark)\nEKN (Sweden)\nFinnvera (Finland)\nGIEK Norway\nHiscox (Bermueda)\nLiberty Specialty Insurance (UK)\nLloyds of London (UK) and associated syndicates\nMIGA (World Bank)\nNEXI (Japan)\nOeKB (Austria)\nOPIC (US)\nPwC Germany (Germany)\nSace (Italy)\nServ (Switzerland)\nSovereign (Bermuda)\nUK Export Finance (UK)\nZurich (US)\n\nb) We harnessed existing political risk contacts to allow for additional recruitment of subjects.

Since any determination of risk would be contingent upon a set of attributes, we designed a conjoint experiment. The conjoint design allows us to isolate the effect of individual attributes by explicitly providing a range of relevant and potentially associated aspects of the investment. In doing so, we reduce the necessary amount of satisficing respondents typically engage in, because explicit reference of associated relevant information lowers the cognitive burden on the respondent. To further facilitate comprehension of the task at hand, respondents are presented with investor and location attributes in two adjacent sections. \n\nINVESTOR ATTRIBUTES\nSize of investor parent company  \n-Large (Fortune 500), \n-Medium\n-Small\nCountry of Origin    \n-US\n-Canada\n-UK\n-China\nIndustry of investor \n-Manufacturing for export\n-Manufacturing for domestic production\n-Oil and gas extraction\nLOCATION ATTRIBUTES\nBilateral Investment Treaties  \n-None\n-Treaties with countries other than (country of origin)\n-Treaties with countries including (country of origin)\nLevel of Country Risk \n-OECD Country risk rating of 4 (1=lowest risk, 7 =highest risk), \n-OECD Country risk rating of 5 (1=lowest risk, 7 =highest risk)\nMajor source of foreign aid \n-US\n-Canada\n-UK\n-China\n\nMethods-Analysis\nWe harness a conjoint survey design (Hainmueller, Hopkins, Yamamoto 2014) to estimate the relative importance of different attributes for risk assessment through a paired conjoint with forced choice repeated 12 times.

For each respondent we randomize the order of questions for the first comparisons and then fix this question order the remainder of experiment. This balances assuring that question order effects are not driving our results while at the same time not requiring respondents to continually adjust to a new question order. \n\nWe will estimate and present the AMCE (Average Marginal Component Effect) in Figure 1 \nof the paper.

I predict that these many outcomes are linked to the treatment through a smaller set of mechanisms, each of which I discuss below.\n The intervention is an asset transfer combined with the option to relocate to the new apartments. Subsidized prices for the asset lead to an increase in a household\u2019s permanent income; while households do not immediately realize the income effect of the subsidy as they cannot sell their apartments for until 10 years after possession, I assume that they smooth their lifetime consumption across time periods with this subsidy in mind (Friedman 1957). I will measure changes in consumption of items with long-term payout ratios such as education, the education of women in particular, and medical expenditure. As income is also correlated with psychological well-being, I will also measure changes in indicators such as stress, life satisfaction and an individual\u2019s locus of control. Additionally, I will investigate the claim made by DiTella et al (2007)  that property ownership leads to an increased belief in ``market values.\"I refer to this mechanism as the permanent income mechanism. I will assess the impact of property ownership on savings, psychological well-being, belief in market values, and expenditure on education through this mechanism.\n Moreover, as assets are collateral for loans, a household's ability to borrow formally may increase . Voting citizens can be thought of as principals who elect politicians, their agents, to represent their policy preferences. Yet poor voters may place a higher utility on immediate receipt of cash or in-kind services than affecting the policy making process. \nOne way to reduce the incidence of vote-buying is to reduce the voter\u2019s utility from participating in vote buying. Larreguy et al (2015) find that a land titling program in Mexico weakens patterns of vote buying by reducing voters\u2019 reliance on politicians for tenure security. Frey (2015) also claims that Brazil's Bolsa Familia conditional cash transfer program reduces the marginal utility of cash payments to voters, thereby reducing support for clientelistic parties. Similarly, property ownership may decrease the marginal utility from cash or in-kind payments by making an asset available as collateral for loans, thereby generating another source of cash for voters . I refer to this mechanism as the collateral mechanism. I will assess the impact of property ownership on access to formal loans and turning to local leaders and informal loans when faced with shocks this mechanism.\n Asset ownership should also affect the extent to which an individual feels invested in his or her immediate political context. First, as concerns about property value should increase the marginal utility from participating in the policy-making process, I will estimate treatment effects on  voting with the aim of having one\u2019s policy preferences represented (as opposed to identity based or clientelistic voting), and participation in civic associations and town hall meetings. Also, as it would seem that ownership of a fixed asset would decrease a household\u2019s propensity to move from the area, I will measure changes in a household\u2019s predicted likelihood of migrating from the city. I refer to this mechanism as the property values mechanism.\n Moreover, in India and other countries with a large informal sector, property ownership entails the incidence of a property tax, the first and only direct tax most citizens pay. The prevalence of informal labor means that income tax is rarely collected; in fact, in India, only 1% of the country's population paid income tax in 2013.  During  qualitative interviews, most low-income individuals were unaware that they paid sales or value-added taxes and claimed that they paid only property tax to the local municipal government. As a vast literature on state-formation  suggests individuals demand services from the state in exchange for tax payment, I predict that property ownership will also lead individuals to demand higher quality service provision from the local government in sectors such as road quality, maintenance of law and order, and public waste management. I refer to this as the property tax mechanism.\n Finally, the project will investigate the claim made by De La O (2013)  and others that receipt of a government benefit should increase an individual's support for the incumbent party/administration.

If we think about sectarianism in the Arab World from a social psychological perspective, it can be defined as ingroup bias based on one\u2019s affiliation to a particular confessional (religious) group. Sectarianism therefore involves a process of identifying with a confessional group, or categorization of oneself and others along sectarian lines. For this reason, we are particularly interested in testing the effectiveness of self-categorization approaches to prejudice reduction. In particular, we test whether primes emphasizing a common religious identity or primes emphasizing a common national identity are more effective in reducing support for sectarian messages and the spread of hate speech. We are also interested in testing the degree to which messages that are endorsed by trusted religious or political elites are more effective than those that do not. \n\nWe will test the effectiveness of these anti-bias primes in two ways. First, we use a nationally representative field experiment in Lebanon, in which subjects are randomly assigned to receive one of 4 primes (national identity, religious identity, national identity elite, religious identity elite) or are assigned to a control group and do not receive a prime. After receiving a prime (or no prime), subjects will be asked to rate several tweets containing sectarian and counter-sectarian rhetoric according to how favorably they feel towards each message and its author and how likely they would be to share the message with others. These ratings will be our primary outcome variables of interest.\n\nIn addition to our survey experiment, we will conduct a Twitter experiment in order to get a better sense of the effectiveness of these anti-bias messages in reducing the use of sectarian hate speech over time in a more organic setting. Following Munger (2016), we will assign subjects to a treatment arm, where they will receive a counter-sectarian (anti-bias) message from a Twitter bot account that we control, in response to one of their recent tweets containing a sectarian slur. These messages will be adapted from the four primes in the survey experiment (national identity, religious identity, national identity elite, religious identity elite). We will also include a control group of Twitter users that receive no message from our bots as well as a group that receives a placebo counter-sectarian message that does not emphasize a superordinate identity or elite support. The primary outcome variable of interest in the Twitter experiment will be the frequency with which subjects tweet sectarian content post-treatment, relative to the pre-treatment period.

It is therefore possible for us to simultaneously hold multiple identities (Turner et al. 1987), and these identities vary with regard to their degree of inclusiveness (Brewer 2003). Self-categorization is dynamic, as several identity levels can be activated at the same time, and one can move up and down levels of identification, depending on the salience of certain category cues and contextual effects (Crisp and Hewstone 2007; Dovidio and Gaertner 2010, Oakes 2001). \n\nIdentification is not set in stone, and this fluidity is why many have advocated approaching prejudice reduction from a self-categorization perspective. A wide variety of studies have shown that identity re-categorization, or the process of shifting from a lower-level identity (e.g. sect) to a higher order superordinate identity (e.g. national identity) consistently results in more positive attitudes and feelings towards members of an outgroup. As those who were previously seen as outgroup members are re-categorized as fellow in-group members in the higher order category, attitudes improve (Gaertner and Dovidio 2000). However, it is unclear how effective this approach would be in the Lebanese (or Arab) context where sectarian identities transcend national boundaries and continue to play a role in several protracted violent regional conflicts. Motivated by findings in the self-categorization literature, we hypothesize:\n\nH1a: Priming national identity will lead to lower favorability ratings of sectarian messages and the individuals who write them, and will make respondents less likely to want to share these messages with their friends, relative to receiving no prime.\n\nGiven the salience of religious identity in shaping sectarian identity, we expect that priming a superordinate religious belief---a common belief in God---will be more effective than priming a common national identity. \n \nH1b: Priming a common belief in God will lead to lower favorability ratings of sectarian messages and the individuals who write them, and will make respondents less likely to want to share these messages with their friends, relative to those who receive a common national identity prime and relative to those who receive no prime.\n\nThe analog of this hypothesis for the Twitter experiment is as follows:\n \nH1a: Receiving a response to a sectarian message that primes national identity will make individuals less likely to tweet sectarian messages in the future, relative to those who receive no prime.\n\nH1b: Receiving a response to a sectarian message that primes a common belief in God will make individuals less likely to tweet sectarian messages in the future, relative to those who receive a common national identity prime and relative to those who receive no prime. \n\nFollowing the literature on top-down approaches to prejudice reduction, we also expect that our counter-sectarian messages will be more effective if they come from trusted political elites or religious leaders. Laboratory experimental evidence suggests that top-down approaches may be particularly effective in the Lebanese context (Kobeissi and Harb 2012). We therefore hypothesize that messages from political elites and religious actors will be more effective at reducing sectarian biases than messages from peers. More specifically, we hypothesize: \n\nH2a: Exposure to a national identity prime that highlights support from political elites will lead to lower favorability ratings of sectarian messages and the individuals who write them, and will make respondents less likely to want to share these messages with their friends, relative to receiving a non-elite national identity prime.\n\nH2b: Exposure to a common belief in God prime that highlights support from religious leaders will lead to lower favorability ratings of sectarian messages and the individuals who write them, and will make respondents less likely to want to share these messages with their friends, relative to receiving a non-elite religious identity prime.\n\nThe analog of this hypothesis for the Twitter experiment is as follows:\n \nH2a: Receiving a response to a sectarian message that primes national identity and highlights support from political elites will make individuals less likely to tweet sectarian messages in the future, relative to those who receive a national identity prime without elite support.\n\nH2b: Receiving a response to a sectarian message that primes a common belief in God and highlights support from religious leaders will make individuals less likely to tweet sectarian messages in the future, relative to those who receive a religious identity prime without elite support.\n\nIn the survey experiment, the primary outcome variables of interest will be respondents\u2019 favorability ratings of several tweets containing sectarian and counter-sectarian rhetoric. These will include how favorably they feel towards each message and its author and how likely they would be to share the message with others.  The primary outcome variable of interest in the Twitter experiment will be the frequency with which subjects tweet sectarian content in the post-treatment period, relative to the pre-treatment period. \n", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Reducing Sectarian Hate Speech Online and in the Field", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "January 25, 2017 / December 23, 2016", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "IRB-FY2017-271 / IRB-FY2016-768", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Alexandra A.

However, modern technologies, booming populations, and burgeoning resource demands have created new challenges for natural resource management. Critically, might natural resource governance improve if communities' capacity were enhanced to monitor resource use? Organized scrutiny by stakeholders has long been suggested as a key method of governing the commons (Ostrom 1990), yet the evidence base to delineate traits relevant to the most effective resource-monitoring systems remains limited. In some realms, such as health care, evidence from a prominent randomized trial suggests that community monitoring can have large effects (Bjorkman and Svensson 2009). In other contexts, however, community monitoring appears to have more modest results (Lassibille et al. 2011) or none at all (Olken 2007). It is possible that new technologies or novel methods of civil society organization may improve the effectiveness of stakeholder watches, but again, these programs await testing through field experiments.  \n\nBroadly, there are two channels by which community monitoring and information collected by monitors might improve resource use. First, as communities learn about their own usage patterns and receive messages regarding the norms of appropriate use, individuals may self-regulate and deliberately decrease unsustainable overuse or otherwise optimize resource extraction for the longer term. This mechanism may be thought of as \u201cbottom-up\u201d regulation. Second, local governance authorities, which we refer to here as \u201cmanagement bodies,\u201d may impose restrictions or sanction the misuse of natural resources through fees, fines, control of licensing, social injunction, and other such \u201ctop-down\u201d regulation, and community monitoring may both inform management bodies' work and increase their effort. These management bodies may be local committees charged with resource regulation or may be more formalized government agencies overseeing usage through licensing and enforcement, and individual teams in the Metaketa engage a range of management bodies at different levels of organization and formality.

Relative to other policy arenas, national security entails a great deal of secrecy. The public is often unable to observe the policy-making process to fully evaluate the consequences of decisions owing to the unavailability of evidence that might help determine if and when things go wrong. This generates a moral hazard problem. The president can exploit secrecy to cover up policies that are poorly thought out, morally controversial, or serve special interests. The president may even be able to conceal missions that fail because of poor execution and planning. If constituents cannot trust the president to speak honestly, accountability in national security policy is much harder. As such, the question of credibility is vital.

It also builds on rational theories of credibility. \n\n\nIf we are right, scandalous rumors present a tense choice for the president: They can admit wrong-doing and accept a lesser punishment or deny rumors and hope that the rumor is never confirmed. If the punishment for lying is large enough, only presidents that believe they are unlikely to be exposed later will deny the rumor. Under the assumption that false rumors are, on average, less likely to be confirmed true, it follows that the fear of being caught in a lie will deter the president from lying in the first place. When wrongdoers are deterred from lying by the fear of getting caught, the act of denial is more persuasive.\n\nOf course, lying is not the only thing the public punishes their leaders for. Discovering that the president has authorized an egregious program is another source of outrage. How much blood the public demands will depend on both whether the president lied and how egregious the rumor is. We expect that denials are only persuasive when the outrage that lying generates is large relative to how bad the policy is. The reason is as follows. If the president admits to an illegal or extremely egregious policy, they will face an enormous punishment with certainty. If a denial presents even a miniscule chance of avoiding this outrage, the president will take it. As a result, no matter if the rumor is true or not, the president will deny their involvement. But since all have incentives to deny it is difficult for the public to judge if the statements are credible. \n\nUnfortunately, this means that the president's denial is the least persuasive on the issues that the public really cares about. When rumors emerge about the most controversial and odious policies, nothing the president says will be persuasive. By contrast, the president will be able to lie most successfully when the public is already skeptical of rumors that emerge. In an era of fake news, this means that the president has little incentive to come clean when a rumor emerges. This makes the media's job more difficult in exposing nefarious government activity. \n\n", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": 500.0, "extra": []}, "id": "20170914AB", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "H1a:  When the public discovers that their leader authorized an unpopular national security program, they will disapprove of their leader more if the leader had previously denied his involvement in the program, than if the leader had never denied involvement.

While substantial investments have been made in satellite monitoring to detect de- forestation events in the region, much of this data remains inaccessible to \u201cfirst responders,\u201d namely communities in the Amazon and, to a lesser extent, the officials tasked with prosecuting these crimes. To what extent does providing this information to the communities most threatened by deforestation allow them to respond to such threats and combat continued deforestation? Further, does facilitating contact between affected communities and government authorities promote increased legal action against offenders? The present field experiment in the Peruvian Amazon will provide indigenous communities with training, technology, and eventually weekly updated data detected by satellite monitoring on threats to their land.

We measure a rich set of outcomes using satellite data, an original endline survey, and administrative data on cases prosecuted to assess the impacts of the community monitoring program. \n\nThis study is poised to make important contributions to both theoretical and policy literature on the governance of common pool resources. First, monitoring of common pool resources by stakeholders has long been considered an important factor in improving governance outcomes (Ostrom 1990). Specifically in the case of forest preservation, the involvement of local communities in the administration and monitoring of forest resources has been widely debated. However, despite increased attention to and funding of community led projects through international aid and REDD+ grants, existing studies on relative effectiveness of community participation are severely limited by observational methodology that cannot measure an unbiased causal effect (Macura, Secco, and Pullin, 2015). This will be one of the first studies with a randomized treatment assignment that can obtain unbiased measurement of community monitoring in the Amazon region of South America, one of the largest and most important forest resources for mitigating global climate change and preserving biodiversity. Secondly, we hope to contribute to existing literature by providing evidence on diverse causal mechanisms that could allow communities to better manage forest resources through monitoring, either through increased organizational capacity, reinforcing of prescriptive norms, or intervention by national authorities.\n", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "73 Indigenous communities in the Napo and Amazon River Basins (Loreto, Peru).", "extra": []}, "id": "20170915AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "C90, C93, K42, O13, Q00, Q01, Q23, Q57", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "Main Hypotheses, Satellite Data\nHypothesis 1.

Despite the vast sum of money spent each year, little evidence exists on the effectiveness of emergency aid. Research on humanitarian assistance is challenging as it must overcome security concerns, logistical hurdles, a relative paucity of high quality monitoring data, and the urgency of humanitarian action. At the same time, there is an increasing demand from donors, policy-makers and implementing agencies to know what works and why, as this is directly linked to the efficient use of limited resources to achieve development outcomes. \nIn the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), humanitarian actors have been present for over 20 years in response to on-going armed conflict and low state capacity in the mountainous east of the country. Acute crises such as population displacement and natural disasters exacerbate a situation of chronic vulnerability, especially among the rural population. As of May 2017, the IDMC estimated that ongoing conflicts in North and South Kivu and an increase in inter-communal clashes in southern and central regions such as Tanganyika, the Kasais, Ituri and Uele, had caused 922,000 people to be displaced from their homes, with an additional 130,000 displaced due to natural disasters over the course of 2016 alone.  The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) estimates there are some 3.8 million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in DRC as of May 2017, the highest number in Africa. Most of these IDPs lack sufficient access to food, clean water, and sanitation facilities, and threats to security are pervasive. Similar conditions hold even for most non-displaced rural populations in the east.  \n\nIn May 2014, the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie), in partnership with the DRC Humanitarian Pooled Fund (HPF), requested qualifications from research teams interested in studying the effectiveness of humanitarian assistance in eastern Congo.  HPF and 3ie matched qualified research teams with humanitarian organizations that had previously expressed interest in the methods promoted by 3ie. Our research team was matched with the Rapid Response to Movements of Population (RRMP) program, jointly managed by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and OCHA. The program that evolved into RRMP began in 2004. Currently, RRMP8 (May 2017 \u2013 April 2018) provides humanitarian assistance to groups of 500 or more households in North Kivu, South Kivu, Ituri, ex-Katanga and Tanganyika who have fled from armed conflict or natural disasters, or have recently returned to their home communities after such displacement.  The program also responds to epidemics such as cholera. The RRMP8 budget is approximately 21 million USD. \nRRMP is a complex program that provides assistance with non-food items, health, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), and education. To reach a consensus on a feasible and relevant study design, representatives from HPF, UNICEF, OCHA, the NGOs that implement RRMP, and the research team met a number of times over three years. The final design focuses on the largest component of RRMP: vouchers for non-food items. Thus, this study aims to generate high quality evidence to answer the following research question: \n\nWhat is the effect of humanitarian assistance (specifically the provision of vouchers for non-food items (NFI)) provided to recently displaced or returned persons, and vulnerable host families, on health and well-being? \n", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": 1400.0, "extra": []}, "id": "20170919AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "I15, I38, D74, H84", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "We focus on four families of primary outcomes: 1) physical health, 2) mental health, 3) social cohesion, and 4) resilience.

Since the original studies on the effectiveness of mass propaganda (e.g., Lasswell 1938; Smith, Lasswell and Casey 1946), scholars have sought to understand the components of successful persuasive appeals: the identity of the messenger, the contents of the message, and how it is delivered. In the latter category reside all of the classical tools of rhetoric -- figurative language, logical structure, satire -- as well as more recent factors such as the type of medium employed. In this study, we hope to inaugurate a new line of research that returns to these fundamental concerns using cutting-edge methods.\n\nOur observation is that one of the most commonly used rhetorical tools, both in political discourse and in everyday discussion, has hardly ever been studied in a systematic manner. That tool is humor. \"Humor is the affectionate communication of insight,\" said Leo Rosten, and anyone who has sought to convince others of their point of view has likely stumbled upon the disarming power of a well-delivered joke. Yet this proverbial arrow in the rhetorical quiver has rarely been subjected to the sort of rigorous scrutiny that other components of the persuasive process have undergone in the research literature.

", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "Taxation is crucial for development because it endows governments with resources needed to provide public services, and it encourages citizens to demand effective and responsive governments (Huntington 1991; Ross 2004; Paler 2013). Yet, many developing countries are trapped in a vicious cycle in which governments are unresponsive and unaccountable, the provision of quality public services is lacking, and tax compliance is low. \n\nA vast scholarship has studied why some individuals comply with their taxes, and others do not. Yet, much of this work has focused on developed countries. Hence, the lessons learned may be specific to countries where citizens should expect that the government will use tax revenues to deliver public services, and that they are visible, or \"legible\" (Scott, 1998), to the state through civil and commercial registration systems.\n\nIn developing countries, in contrast, government use of tax revenues to provide services may be questionable.  The informal sector also remains very large in developing countries (McKenzie and Woodruff 2013), often with a majority of small businesses operating in the informal sector of the economy, millions of people living in informal settlements, and a disproportionate number of households lacking formal access to public services. In this context, could formalization trigger a chain of effects that has governments respond by providing services, and then culminates in an increase in tax compliance?\n\nLike tax compliance, a citizen's decision to formalize its relation with the state seems to be the result of a comparison of the expected benefits of formalization to its expected costs (Perry, et al. 2007; McKenzie and Sakho 2010; Neuwirth 2011). In the case of formalization, however, costs not only include future tax liability but, in many cases, include a costly and complex process. People in the informal sector may lack the information, time, and resources (financial and human capital) to navigate the bureaucracy and oftentimes arcane regulations. Moreover, in many cases, citizens are not certain that benefits of formalization will materialize. Then, the high costs of the process  of formalization and its uncertain benefits may deter citizens from transitioning to the formal sector.     \n\nExperimental work on the topic has found that interventions that only provide information about the process of registration, including its benefits, have no effect on firms' decision to formalize (Andrade et al. 2013; De Giorgi and Rahman 2013; Bruhn and McKenzie 2014). More expensive interventions, such as cash payments or business training, lead to higher rates of formalization (De Mel et al. 2013; Benhassine et al. 2016), but these are not cost-effective interventions, and they may not produce durable effects (Galiani et al. 2016). Finally, a few studies have shown that interventions that offered information about the process of formalization and assistance to people to undergo such process lead to higher rates of formalization (Campos et al. 2015; Benhassine et al. 2016; Galiani et al. 2016). However, the generalizability of these studies may limited. In Benhassine et al. (2016)'s and Galiani et al. (2016)'s studies, samples were drawn from Benin's largest city (Cotonou), and Colombia's capital city (Bogota). In Campos et al. (2015)'s study, the sample included firms with larger revenues (25 percentile and above), with a fixed location, with more than one person working in the business, and with at least one worker contracted outside of family members and business owners. Hence, these studies show that in large cities, and among more profitable firms, there may be a latent demand for formalization, which is blocked by transaction costs. Yet, it is unclear whether the effects of the bundled treatment of information and assistance could be generalized to small- and mid- size firms outside of urban centers. Moreover, these studies have focused on the process of formalization of a business, which may not produce generalizable lessons for other formalization processes, such as the acquisition of a land title, or the formal access to basic public services.    \n\nThe six projects in this Metaketa, and our meta-analysis, aim to contribute to this literature by studying the effects of a common treatment arm, to be implemented in a consistent manner by all projects, which combines information about the process of formalization, its benefits and costs, as well as assistance and/or subsidies to remove transaction-cost type barriers that impede those who otherwise wish to formalize to do so. Although the contexts of the projects are different, spanning from Colombia to India, in all cases preliminary field work by PIs suggests that there is a latent high demand for the formalization processes included in this Metaketa, which is probably driven by the tangible benefits associated with them, including the possibility to access valuable public services. Moreover, in all cases citizens pay costs of remaining in the informal sector, including unofficial payments, dependence on non-state utilities providers that extract high rates in exchange for low quality services, uncertainty, and fear of government repression. We will explore if the common treatment arm, which will encourage citizens to formalize its relation with the state, helps establish a fiscal contract between citizens and their governments, whereby local governments deliver public goods in exchange for tax compliance  (Levi 1989; Tyler 1990;  Levi and Sacks 2009; Paler 2013; Ali et al. 2014).", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "Please see individual projects' registration for sample size information.", "extra": []}, "id": "20171010AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "C93, H26, H41, H42", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "Our primary hypotheses are: 1) Common treatment arm increases citizen's intent to formalize, and ultimately increases formalization of, their relationship with the government. 2)  Common treatment arm increases citizen's access to public services tightly related to the formalization process, and reduces reliance on non-public providers of such services. 3) Common treatment arm increases citizen's tax compliance (i.e. payment of taxes or dues for services provided) directly related to the process of formalization.\n\nWe also have a set of secondary hypotheses that are not directly involved on the process of formalization, but that could be impacted as a result of a citizen formalizing its relation with the state, becoming a tax payer (in specific tax domain related to formalization), and experiencing public service provision (or lack thereof): 1) Common treatment arm improves citizen's attitudes towards the government. 2) Common treatment arm increases civic and political participation. 3) Common treatment arm  increases citizen's access to other public services. 4) Common treatment arm improves citizen's tax morale more generally, and increases willingness to pay taxes not directly involved with the formalization process. 5) Common treatment arm affects perceptions about prevalence of non-compliance with taxation, as well as probability of being caught not paying taxes, and the severity of the punishment associated with it. \n\nFinally, we expect that some baseline covariates will act as moderators, including: benefits of formalization, baseline attitudes towards the government, and baseline access to public goods.

It aims to test whether citizens can influence policy, not only indirectly through electing politicians, but more directly by providing information to bureaucrats who have discretion over agency or departmental budgets. \nNo comprehensive framework exists yet to understand how bureaucrats respond to citizen information. Gaining a better understanding of the influence of citizen feedback on bureaucrats could help to address undemocratic inequalities caused by bureaucrats delivering services in a discriminating manner (Scott 1997; Theobald & Haider-Markel 2009; Riccucci, Van Ryyzin & Lavena 2014; White, Nathan & Faller 2015). Beyond that, an understanding of the mode and extent to which citizens can influence bureaucratic decision-making can inform literature on public sector performance management. The conception of a citizen as a silent influencer sits squarely between approaches related to New Public Management (NPM) and participatory initiatives. The former locates responsibility to cater to citizen needs with bureaucrats and politicians alone. Bureaucrats are incentivised by politicians to treat citizens like consumers and cater to their needs (Andrews 2011; Hood 2015). Participatory initiatives, on the other hand, stress the need for citizens to actively call for and coproduce what they want the public sector to provide  (O\u2019Dwyer 2005; Ryfe 2005; Fung 2006; Chadwick 2011; Street, Duszynski, Krawczyck & Braunack-Mayer 2014; Voorberg, Bekkers & Tummers 2015).This study is agnostic to the theoretical advantages of either approach. Instead, it relies on experimental methods to determine how people act, given different incentive structures. Some of the tested incentives are more akin to what is advocated under NPM (transparency, feedback from politicians, electoral control), while others are closer to participatory approaches (feedback from citizens). \n", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": 300.0, "extra": []}, "id": "20171013AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "H1 Bureaucrat players will allocate more budget to citizens when they receive any feedback compared to when they do not receive citizen feedback. \nH1 a This effect is expected to remain significant in the presence of elections, and\nH1 b elections and politician feedback.\nH2a If feedback is task-specific, bureaucrats will allocate more budget to citizen players than when feedback if normative.\nH2b If bureaucrats are asked to formulate an action plan about how to allocate budget alongside receiving specific feedback, they will allocate more budget to citizens than when they only receive specific feedback. \nH3 Regardless of the type of feedback given, bureaucrats allocate increasingly more to citizens as they move through stages\nH4 Bureaucrats adjust their allocations in the direction that the politician requests through feedback.\nH5 Bureaucrats adjust their allocations in the direction that the politician requests through feedback.\n", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Bureaucratic responsiveness under varying feedback", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": 43046.0, "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "11311/001", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Annabelle Wittels", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Researchers", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "The study set-up approximates a decision scenario similar to that found in bureaucracies. It aims to test the impact of citizen feedback on bureaucratic decision-making. Participants are assigned a role in a strict hierarchy which determines their power over resource allocation: they have powers and face constraints akin to that of a politician, bureaucrat or citizen. Resources can be used to benefit all participants or they can benefit some individuals or their own political causes over others, akin to pork barrel politics (Lancaster 1986). Bureaucrats have opportunity for slack, spending resources on themselves rather than projects (see Wyckoff, 1990, Cyert & March 1963 and O\u2019Toole & Meier 2010 for more in-depth definitions). \nThe aim is to test (i) whether participant behaviours follow patterns that are expected from the given incentive structures and (ii) whether these patterns can be altered through the introduction of feedback mechanisms between participants. The main interest lies in assessing whether introducing feedback from citizens to bureaucrats alters allocation decisions in a manner that differs significantly from allocation decisions made under existing forms of influence between politicians, citizens and bureaucrats, i.e. elections and public monitoring mechanisms.  \nAfter the first stage which imposes no additional conditions and decisions are opaque , transparency is introduced (; all participants know how much the others allocated to the different causes. The third stage introduces elections . The fourth public performance frameworks; the politician can provide feedback to the bureaucrat . The last stage introduces citizen feedback for bureaucrats . \nStructures of the study are designed so that two participants face simplified but similar powers over budgets and constraints as politicians. The governing politician can outsource decision-making by allocating budgets to bureaucracies, they can directly invest in causes that benefit the population as a whole or they can keep resources for their own political purposes. The opposition politician has to wait for an opportunity to be elected to receive powers over state resource allocation. The incentive framework within which they can take this decisions is manipulated during the study. \nAnother role approximates the resource allocation framework of a bureaucrat. Bureaucrats receive a budget per period by the politician. With that budget they can then decide whether to allocate it to projects that broadly benefit the public or on the voter base of the politician, the citizen player. They can also keep some money to themselves (\u2018slack\u2019). \nThe last role mimics that of the citizen. They can influence resource allocation through the election of politicians. \nTo test the malleability of behavioural outcomes the study uses a 3x5 mixed factorial design. Each participant is exposed to five stages of treatment. These stages allow to distinguish between effects introduced by transparency, elections, feedback given by politicians to bureaucrats and feedback given by citizens to bureaucrats. The within-subject design controls for individual differences on metrics such as generosity or authority worship. In addition, all participants are randomly allocated to one of three treatment conditions. They either receive nominal feedback , which assigns broad categories to performance (\u201cexceed\u201d, \u201cmeet expectations\u201d, \u201cmust improve\u201d). This type of feedback is modelled on performance ratings used for civil servants in the UK which was introduced in 2012/13. The second group receives specific feedback , which details where allocations should be increased and where allocations should be decreased. The third group receives a prompt to form an action plan for allocating money in the next spending period in addition to specific feedback . This between-group comparison means that we cannot only assess the impact of citizen feedback on bureaucratic decision-making, but also test whether the type of feedback influences the direction and magnitude of the effect. \n", "extra": []}, "q20": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q19": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q7": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q12": {"comments": [], "value": "United States", "extra": []}, "q4": {"comments": [], "value": "Registration prior to any research activities", "extra": []}, "timestamp": "10/13/2017 - 05:50"}, {"q5": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q6": {"comments": [], "value": 43025.0, "extra": []}, "q15": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q9": {"comments": [], "value": "Can citizens tell whether politicians statements are true or false?

As such, reducing deforestation is considered one of the most cost-effective ways of reducing carbon emissions (Stern, 2006). Although the majority of the world\u2019s forest area is administered by governments, a small but growing proportion of forest area is officially designated to be managed by Indigenous People and local communities. In the continent of Africa in particular, the share of forest area that is officially designated as such has increased from 3.9 per cent in 2002 to 5.8 per cent in 2013. These estimates do not include any formally government administered forest area that is de facto managed by local communities or Indigenous People because of weaknesses in enforcement of government legislation. The appeal of community forest management appears widespread, with \u201cnearly every country in the world [\u2026] experimenting with some form of \u2018Community Forestry\u2019\u201d (Edmonds, 2002). At the international level, the REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) aims to avoid deforestation. Communities are envisioned to contribute to measurement of carbon stocks embodied in forests as required by REDD+ Monitoring Reporting and Verification (MRV) (Government of Uganda, 2011; Kenya Forest Serivce, 2010). Deforestation is an important problem in Uganda, with some coining the deforestation rate in Uganda as the \u201chighest in East Africa\u201d (Banana, Bukenya, Arinaitwe, Birabwa, & Ssekindi, 2012). According to data from Global Forest Watch, 38 per cent of the land area in Uganda is covered by forest, and Ugandan forests are under a high risk of deforestation. The annual deforestation rate in Uganda amounted to 5.7% between 2001 and 2014. Deforestation and land use change contribute 37.6 percent to Uganda\u2019s Greenhouse Gas emissions in 2011 (FAO data). Communities in Uganda play an important role both in forest management as well as in deforestation. Communities can (co)manage forests that are collectively privately owned, that are registered as community forests, or that are covered by a Collaborative Forest Management agreement (Government of Uganda, 2003). Correspondingly, one of Uganda\u2019s National Forestry policy objectives linked to REDD+ is to \u201cpromote innovative approaches to community participation in forest management\u201d. However, communities also engage in charcoal production, firewood harvesting, and livestock grazing, which are three out of the seven main drivers of deforestation as identified by Uganda\u2019s REDD+ Readiness Preparation Proposal (Government of Uganda, 2011). The Ugandan REDD+ Readiness Preparation Proposal furthermore envisions that communities could be involved in forest monitoring under REDD+ MRV. It recognizes that communities, with support from NGOs have contributed to high-quality monitoring systems in other countries, such as Nepal. At the same time, it acknowledges that \u201ccommunity monitoring capacity is still relatively weak\u201d (Government of Uganda, 2011).", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "110 villages, 1100 households at baseline, 1200 households at endline", "extra": []}, "id": "20171020AA", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "Q23", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "H1.

Two decades of instability and conflict has led to the erosion of the state\u2019s capacity to provide basic services. It has also weakened communities\u2019 ability to be informed, to mobilize for collective action, and to monitor and influence frontline service providers. In Eastern Congo, the local governance system related to service delivery is thus largely unresponsive to the service delivery needs and priorities of the population.\n\nIt is against this backdrop that in 2007, funded by UK\u2019s DFID, the IRC and CARE International implemented the Tuungane program (\u201cTuungane\u201d means \u201clet\u2019s unite\u201d in Swahili). A first phase was implemented between 2007 and 2012. A second phase took place between 2012 and 2015. In 2015, Tuungane implemented an extension called Tuungane 2+ (or T2+) to ensure sustainability of the second phase. T2+ is implemented in 485 communities in three provinces of Eastern Congo: South Kivu, Haut Katanga and Tanganyika, reaching approximately one million beneficiaries. The components of the T2+ program include (a) capacity building of recently decentralized government units (so-called \u201cETDs\u201d), (b) radio-related activities to support accountability and citizen participation in local governance, (c) a gender pilot aimed to improve women\u2019s possibilities for effectively participating in, and influencing, community decision-making, and (d) grant projects in communities with a grant sizes of $8,990 in the health and education sectors and $2,358 for water and sanitation sectors. The goal of the Tuungane 2+ program is \u201cto contribute to a local governance system that is responsive to the service delivery needs and priorities of the population, beyond the end of the program (IRC, 2014:4)\u201d by ensuring the sustainability of the investment of the second phase of Tuungane.\n\nThe Tuungane 2+ program takes the form of an experiment. The program\u2019s grant projects component is implemented as a two-by-two factorial, in those communities that undertake projects in the health and education sector (339 communities). In Congo, day-to-day problem-solving and decision-making about local service delivery challenges are made by frontline service providers and user committee members during their monthly meetings. The interface space between these two actors is therefore of particular importance to local service delivery quality and related outcomes. However, this space may not be optimally utilized. Two sets of actors have access to and influence over the user committee and frontline service provider interface: service users (via their user committee) and line ministry staff (via frontline service providers). The interactions between these actors and user committees and frontline service providers are often irregular and of low quality. Thus, in addition to the main intervention that aims to strengthen ties between user committee members and frontline service providers, a randomly selected half of communities receive a set of additional activities to involve the users. Furthermore, a randomly selected half of communities receive a set of additional activities to involve the relevant line ministries in decision-making about service provision.

And if politics or political attitudes helps explain why people identify with certain social groups or if politics help transform social identities into political identities, then correlational estimates do not give us a good sense of social group influence.\n\nThe experimental data also show mixed evidence of social group influence. In many experiments, social group cues don\u2019t correspond with changes in policy attitudes. This may be that the identities are already aligned. In other words, we may not see group cues shaping attitudes on issues when there is already agreement as there is nowhere to move. Therefore, experiments that look at policy attitudes may not give us a good sense of social group influence. \n\nThe main research question, therefore, is how might social group influence play a role in a world in which political and social identities are frequently aligned?\n", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "id": "20171024AB", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "The experiment will test how individuals who self-identify as part of one of three groups\u2014African Americans, evangelical Christians, and feminists\u2014respond to political cues from their social groups.

Moreover, the three identities are closely aligned with one of the two main political parties: white evangelicals are disproportionately Republicans while feminists and African Americans are disproportionately Republicans. \n\nGiven how closely aligned these social and political identities are, the first main hypothesis of the experiment is that a social group cue does not have an effect on reported attitudes.  Instead, when group identities and political attitudes are aligned, social group\u2019s influence is more likely to be seen in their ability to mobilize. As such, the second main hypothesis of the experiment is that a social group cue can impact a group member\u2019s willingness to act politically on the issue at hand and likelihood of reporting that the issue is an important issue. When group members already hold attitudes that are consistent with the social group's position, group influence is seen through increased salience and mobilization. Conversely, social group cues should demobilize group members when identities and attitudes are not aligned (This hypothesis may be difficult to empirically test as it will depend on how many group members hold unaligned identities and attitudes). \n\nIdentity strength is a potential moderator that may be interacted with the treatment. From this, two additional hypotheses emerge. First, identity strength should not be a moderator that affects how group identifiers respond to the treatment when the dependent variable is issue positions. While strong group identifiers may be more likely to respond to the treatment, there may be no room for movement as strong identifiers are the most likely to already hold the group's position. Second, identity strength should be a moderator that affects how group identifiers respond to the treatment when the dependent variable is mobilization and issue salience.\n\nThe nature of the current political environment lends itself to a few additional hypotheses that can be explored using these data. In particular, there is a literature that notes non-religious people using evangelicalism as a negative cue (see Adkins et al. 2013; Bolce and De Main 1999). As such, an additional hypothesis is that religious non-identifiers who receive the evangelical cue may respond in the opposite direction of the cue (that is, take a more liberal position) compared to non-evangelicals in the control condition (hypothesis from existing research). It is also possible, however, that religious non-identifiers also take a sufficiently unified liberal position that the evangelical group cue does not produce a detectable effect on policy attitudes (alternative hypothesis). Drawing on the same anti-evangelical literature, religious non-identifiers who hold liberal policy positions on issues in question and receive the evangelical cue should be more likely to mobilize around the policy issue--in the opposite direction of the evangelical cue--than the religious non-identifiers who do not receive the evangelical cue.  It is possible that the same backlash may exist among non-feminists who receive the feminist treatment; however, there is not empirical evidence showing that non-feminists respond negatively to feminism although there is reason to suspect it may be a possibility. \n", "extra": []}, "q3": {"comments": [], "value": "Yes", "extra": []}, "q1": {"comments": [], "value": "Group cues and political mobilization and salience", "extra": []}, "q17": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q16": {"comments": [], "value": "", "extra": []}, "q2": {"comments": [], "value": "Michele Margolis", "extra": []}, "q8": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q18": {"comments": [], "value": "Researchers", "extra": []}, "q11": {"comments": [], "value": "The hypotheses will be tested using straightforward methods.

In a country without a history of robust judicial power or strong democratic norms (Mueller 2008; Mutua 2001), this episode presents a crucial test of the Kenyan Supreme Court\u2019s legitimacy, or rightful authority to render declarative rulings for the polity (e.g., Gibson and Nelson 2014; Tyler 2006a). Scholars and experts believe that granting high courts robust constitutional authority is necessary for enforcing the rule of law, maintaining judicial independence, and ensuring democratic governance (e.g., Baird 2001; Gibson, Caldeira, and Baird 1998; Ginsburg 2003; Widner 2001). A strong high court depends on widespread subscription to judicial supremacy\u2014the principle that the court has the final word on constitutional meaning for everyone in the country (Friedman 1998; Friedman and Delaney 2011; Whittington 2007).

Nonetheless, traditional gender conceptions revolving around women as victims rather than agents continue to have traction and have halted the internalization and undermined the universality of norms promoting women\u2019s agency. As a result, global gender norms are activated and implemented unevenly. We designed a vignette experiment to test our theoretical expectation that global norms of women\u2019s participation are more likely to be activated when a conflict emerges as visibly gendered in terms of prevalent sexual violence. We suggest that sexual violence serves as a heuristic for international actors in determining the gendered nature of a conflict, due to the massive increase in global awareness of this type of violence.

At the same time, wartime sexual violence rose on the global agenda in the wake of the genocide in Rwanda and the civil war in Bosnia. Media coverage of conflict-related sexual violence has since increased rapidly. These developments have had two consequences: 1) sexual violence is increasingly viewed as a grave problem in conflict and 2) normative contention has arisen between women's protection and women's participation prescriptions, to the detriment of the latter. Accordingly, the notion that gender matters in a variety of ways and that women\u2019s participation is a necessity in all (post-)conflict settings has not been internalized by the majority of international actors and observers. Even though virtually all conflicts are highly gendered in different dimensions \u2013 e.g. male-dominated fighting and the disproportionate displacement of women \u2013 sexual violence has come to be seen as the foremost issue affecting women in conflict situations. In other words, a conflict is considerably less likely to be perceived as gendered in the absence of documented widespread sexual violence, and hence less likely to elicit a \"gendered response\" by international actors and observes. This yields an expectation of the uneven activation of global gender norms:\n\nH1: Respondents are more likely to support international intervention in a conflict with widespread sexual violence compared to a conflict with overall widespread violence.\n\nH2: Respondents are more likely to acknowledge the importance of enhancing women\u2019s participation in peace processes in a conflict with widespread sexual violence compared to a conflict with overall widespread violence.\n\nWe are further interested in the relationship between ethnic and sexual violence. We seek to explore if \u2013 as has been suggested in the existing literature on the inclusion of groups in peace agreements (Bell and O\u2019Rourke 2010) \u2013 ethnic violence sidelines gender concerns. Previous literature has dedicated very little time and space to the question of whether ethnic concerns crowd out gender concerns.

Our second outcome captures the rank-ordering of different priority areas for engagement in post-conflict settings, one of which is the inclusion and empowerment of women in the peace process.

We seek to test these various possibilities experimentally, through specific experiments which attempt to operationalize these differing hypotheses.

We will then estimate 2) whether this effect varies by respondents' levels of information (measured via education and media consumption). We will also examine the effects by 3) self-reported health status (having a pre-existing condition and self-reported health status), as well as 4) attitudes toward the parties and Obama (measured via the Obama feeling thermometer, partisanship, and 2016 vote choice).  \n\nA second experiment instead examines the role of partisan priming. Specifically, some respondents were randomly assigned to report their attitudes toward the ACA after being asked for their 2016 candidate preference and approval/disapproval of Donald Trump, while for others, the order of those questions was reversed. Again, we will first 1) estimate the overall effects of this randomization. We will then analyze 2) differences by partisanship (using the Trump and Obama feeling thermometers as well as party ID and 2016 vote choice) and 3) information (using education and media consumption). \n\nIn another experiment, we seek to understand the role of attitudes and cues related to ethnic/racial groups in shaping ACA-related attitudes. Our survey explained that the ACA had extended insurance to approximately 17 million Americans, and randomly assigned respondents to read an additional clause indicating that 7 million of those people were Hispanic or African American or not. Here, we propose to 1) analyze the overall effects, and then analyze the effects for non-Hispanic white respondents broken out by their 2) political partisanship (party ID, 2016 self-reported vote choice, and Trump feeling thermometer) and 3) attitudes toward these groups, as expressed by the difference in their feeling thermometer ratings of these groups relative to Whites. Following Hetherington (2006), we also propose to examine the results 4) by levels of governmental trust. \n\nA fourth experiment, also building off Hetherington (2006), considers the role of low government trust in shaping ACA attitudes. Some respondents received an ideological anti-ACA message while others saw a low-trust anti-ACA message and still others saw no message at all. Here, we will consider the 1) overall effects as well as 2) the effects broken out by respondents' self-reported social trust and governmental trust. We will also 3) examine the results by partisanship, measured via 2016 vote choice and 7-category party ID.   \n\nA fifth experiment considers the effect of labeling a measure as \"repealing the ACA.\" Specifically, it either does or does not label the September 2017 Graham-Cassidy proposal explicitly as repealing the Affordable Care Act. We will examine its 1) overall effects as well as 2) its effects by information (education and media consumption) and 3) by partisanship.\n\nThe sixth experiment is highly similar to the fifth: in a list of potential priorities related to the ACA, some respondents saw \"repealing Obamacare\" while others saw \"repealing the Affordable Care Act.\" We will examine 1) the overall effect as well as 2) the effect by political partisanship and the Obama feeling thermometer and also 3) by information (measured via education and media consumption) and 4) racial attitudes (measured via feeling thermometers). \n\nThe seventh experiment is also a list of ranked priorities in which respondents could rank the importance of providing health care for \"all Americans\" or for \"poor Americans.\" Here, too, we will analyze the 1) overall effect as well as 2) the effect by the Trump feeling thermometer and by 3) self-reported income and 4) racial affect. \n\nThe eighth experiment examined the same ranking of priorities, but instead involved either including an item that read \"reducing spending on Medicaid\" or else read \"reducing spending on Medicaid, which provides health insurance to older and low-income Americans.\" Here, we will examine the overall effects as well as those broken out 2) by racial attitudes, 3) self-interest (measured via age and income), and 4) political partisanship.

In this project, we seek to answer the question of how citizens form their attitudes towards provisions included in a particular set of important agreements: peace agreements. Specifically, we argue that in low information and highly polarized contexts, acquiring information is costly and, thus, citizens will rely on elite cues to form their opinions about complex provisions included in peace agreements. In particular, even if citizens are generally be supportive of peace processes overall, their support for specific provisions may be contingent on elites' endorsements. We argue that facing complex provisions as part of peace processes, less informed individuals will likely take elite cues as information shortcuts to base their attitudes and public support for these specific provisions.  \n\nWe assess our theory in the context of Colombia's  peace process, where we use an endorsement experiment in a survey to test for the effects of elite cues on voters' attitudes toward certain proposals included in the peace agreement signed between the government and the FARC in 2016. Understanding the effect of elite endorsements, in conflict settings, has several theoretical implications. First, this project will provide novel evidence on the sources of citizen attitude formation in contexts of violence, and, specifically, what effects elite cues have on support for rehabilitation and other crucial components of peace-building. As such, it contributes to the literature on public opinion that has long studied how citizens form their attitudes, but given several factors that may change that process. Second, as more countries with elections negotiate settlements to civil conflict, citizens' involvement in peace processes increases, either by directly by voting in a referendum or by voting on those who negotiated it, or by indirectly resisting or supporting rehabilitation of ex-combatants and other policies. Understanding what shapes citizens attitudes toward peace agreements becomes highly relevant and may point to places where inclusion is more or less beneficial for the prospects of peace. \n", "extra": []}, "q13": {"comments": [], "value": 1500.0, "extra": []}, "id": "20171104AB", "q22": {"comments": [], "value": "x", "extra": []}, "q14": {"comments": [], "value": "No", "extra": []}, "q21": {"comments": [], "value": "D74", "extra": []}, "q10": {"comments": [], "value": "Main outcomes of interest:\n1.

Many prejudice reduction interventions use television and radio media programs to engage viewers in \"vicarious intergroup contact\".   In vicarious contact, the ingroup member observes another ingroup member interact with an outgroup member.  Though the viewer does not directly interact with an outgroup member, the interaction she observes between a fellow ingroup member and the outgroup member provides information to the viewer about what could happen if she interacted with an outgroup member.  If the interaction is positive, the viewer should have more positive affect towards the outgroup, similar to direct intergroup contact.  \n\nVicarious intergroup contact motivates peacebuilding interventions in violent areas and popular films such as Remember the Titans.  It is especially appealing as a prejudice reduction intervention because the quality of the vicarious intergroup contact is controlled.  The characters are scripted, so positive contact meeting Allport's four conditions can be ensured: group members interacting (1) cooperatively, for (2) a joint goal, (3) with equal status, and (4) the support of prevailing authorities.  However, one potentially vital aspect of intergroup contact has not been explored: the ultimate success or failure of the cooperative contact.  Did the cooperation successfully achieve the joint goal, or did the groups fail to achieve their goal?  To continue with the example of Remember the Titans, would that intergroup contact have reduced prejudice if the team had lost every game?\n\nIf contact is only about removing stereotypes, then we might expect that the success or failure of the cooperation will have little to no effect on prejudice reduction.  The interaction itself should reshape stereotypes.  But if contact is also about a utilitarian expectation of desirable outcomes due to intergroup cooperation, then the success or failure of the cooperation could affect prejudice reduction.  A success could lead participants to believe that intergroup cooperation is in their material interest, whereas a failure suggests to them that the groups are better off working alone.\n\nThis study will expose subjects to vicarious intergroup contact that meets all four of Allport's conditions.  One group will see that contact end successfully, and another will see it end unsuccessfully. Everything else about the vicarious contact will remain constant.

I also leave in some more neutral emotions for an exploration.  Those emotions are envy, guilty, respectful, hurt, proud, and secure.\n(2) Reduce threat felt from the out-partisans\n(3) Reduce stereotypes about out-partisans so that treated subjects report smaller differences between Democrats and Republicans\n(4) Decrease social distance to out-partisans\n(5) Reduce infra-humanization of out-partisans (in and out-partisans will be assigned more similar traits)\n(6) More acceptance of joining a group or living in a community with large percentages of out-partisans\n(7) More information seeking about political groups aligned with the out-party.\n\nFor each of these hypotheses, I expect the greatest effect for successful vicarious contact.

(1) - (3) about the video are only asked to people who watched a video.

I expect larger effects with higher physiological activation.\n\nValidity check: For students who watch the videos, to be sure they received the treatment I ask two informational questions.  The first is for general video content and asks what the students in the video worked on.

Another 40% (groups 3 & 4) receive a treatment text intended to lower their fulfilment expectations.

Secondly, the respondents are asked how likely it is that they would vote for the Social Democrats if elections were held today. Finally, the respondents are asked which party they would vote for if elections were held today. After these questions, the mediator is posed, asking respondents whether they feel th Social Democrats generally fulfil most of their election pledges. Finally, a policy preference instrument is posed as a control.
